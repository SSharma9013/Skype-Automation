Human identity, the idea that defines each and every one of us, could be facing an unprecedented crisis.
It is a crisis that would threaten long-held notions of who we are, what we do and how we behave.
It goes right to the heart - or the head - of us all. 
This crisis could reshape how we interact with each other, alter what makes us happy, and modify our capacity for reaching our full potential as individuals.
And it's caused by one simple fact: the human brain, that most sensitive of organs, is under threat from the modern world. 
Unless we wake up to the damage that the gadget-filled, pharmaceutically-enhanced 21st century is doing to our brains, we could be sleepwalking towards a 
future in which neuro-chip technology blurs the line between living and non-living machines, and between our bodies and the outside world.
It would be a world where such devices could enhance our muscle power, or our senses, beyond the norm, and where we all take a daily cocktail of drugs to 
control our moods and performance.
Already, an electronic chip is being developed that could allow a paralysed patient to move a robotic limb just by thinking about it.
 As for drug manipulated moods, they're already with us - although so far only to a medically prescribed extent.
Increasing numbers of people already take Prozac for depression, Paxil as an antidote for shyness, and give Ritalin to children to improve their concentration.
 But what if there were still more pills to enhance or "correct" a range of other specific mental functions?
What would such aspirations to be "perfect" or "better" do to our notions of identity, and what would it do to those who could not get their hands on the pills?
 Would some finally have become more equal than others, as George Orwell always feared?
Of course, there are benefits from technical progress - but there are great dangers as well, and I believe that we are seeing some of those today.
I'm a neuroscientist and my day-to-day research at Oxford University strives for an ever greater understanding - and therefore maybe, one day, a cure - for 
Alzheimer's disease.
But one vital fact I have learnt is that the brain is not the unchanging organ that we might imagine. 
It not only goes on developing, changing and, in some tragic cases, eventually deteriorating with age, it is also substantially shaped by what we do to it and 
by the experience of daily life. 
When I say "shaped", I'm not talking figuratively or metaphorically; I'm talking literally. 
At a microcellular level, the infinitely complex network of nerve cells that make up the constituent parts of the brain actually change in response to certain 
experiences and stimuli.
The brain, in other words, is malleable - not just in early childhood but right up to early adulthood, and, in certain instances, beyond. 
The surrounding environment has a huge impact both on the way our brains develop and how that brain is transformed into a unique human mind.
Of course, there's nothing new about that: human brains have been changing, adapting and developing in response to outside stimuli for centuries.
What prompted me to write my book is that the pace of change in the outside environment and in the development of new technologies has increased dramatically.
 This will affect our brains over the next 100 years in ways we might never have imagined.
Our brains are under the influence of an ever- expanding world of new technology: multichannel television, video games, MP3 players, the internet, wireless 
networks, Bluetooth links - the list goes on and on.
But our modern brains are also having to adapt to other 21st century intrusions, some of which, such as prescribed drugs like Ritalin and Prozac, are supposed 
to be of benefit, and some of which, such as widelyavailable illegal drugs like cannabis and heroin, are not.
Electronic devices and pharmaceutical drugs all have an impact on the micro- cellular structure and complex biochemistry of our brains.
 And that, in turn, affects our personality, our behaviour and our characteristics. In short, the modern world could well be altering our human identity.
Three hundred years ago, our notions of human identity were vastly simpler: we were defined by the family we were born into and our position within that family. 
Social advancement was nigh on impossible and the concept of "individuality" took a back seat.
That only arrived with the Industrial Revolution, which for the first time offered rewards for initiative, ingenuity and ambition. 
Suddenly, people had their own life stories - ones which could be shaped by their own thoughts and actions. 
For the first time, individuals had a real sense of self.
But with our brains now under such widespread attack from the modern world, there's a danger that that cherished sense of self could be diminished or even lost.
Anyone who doubts the malleability of the adult brain should consider a startling piece of research conducted at Harvard Medical School.
 There, a group of adult volunteers, none of whom could previously play the piano, were split into three groups.
The first group were taken into a room with a piano and given intensive piano practise for five days. The second group were taken into an identical room with 
an identical piano - but had nothing to do with the instrument at all.
And the third group were taken into an identical room with an identical piano and were then told that for the next five days they had to just imagine they were 
practising piano exercises.
The resultant brain scans were extraordinary. Not surprisingly, the brains of those who simply sat in the same room as the piano hadn't changed at all.
Equally unsurprising was the fact that those who had performed the piano exercises saw marked structural changes in the area of the brain associated with 
finger movement.
But what was truly astonishing was that the group who had merely imagined doing the piano exercises saw changes in brain structure that were almost as 
pronounced as those that had actually had lessons. "The power of imagination" is not a metaphor, it seems; it's real, and has a physical basis in your brain.
Alas, no neuroscientist can explain how the sort of changes that the Harvard experimenters reported at the micro-cellular level translate into changes in 
character, personality or behaviour. But we don't need to know that to realise that changes in brain structure and our higher thoughts and feelings are 
incontrovertibly linked.
What worries me is that if something as innocuous as imagining a piano lesson can bring about a visible physical change in brain structure, and therefore some 
presumably minor change in the way the aspiring player performs, what changes might long stints playing violent computer games bring about? That eternal 
teenage protest of 'it's only a game, Mum' certainly begins to ring alarmingly hollow.
Already, it's pretty clear that the screen-based, two dimensional world that so many teenagers - and a growing number of adults - choose to inhabit is 
producing changes in behaviour. Attention spans are shorter, personal communication skills are reduced and there's a marked reduction in the ability to think 
abstractly.
This games-driven generation interpret the world through screen-shaped eyes. It's almost as if something hasn't really happened until it's been posted on 
Facebook, Bebo or YouTube.
Add that to the huge amount of personal information now stored on the internet - births, marriages, telephone numbers, credit ratings, holiday pictures - and 
it's sometimes difficult to know where the boundaries of our individuality actually lie. Only one thing is certain: those boundaries are weakening.
And they could weaken further still if, and when, neurochip technology becomes more widely available. These tiny devices will take advantage of the discovery 
that nerve cells and silicon chips can happily co-exist, allowing an interface between the electronic world and the human body. One of my colleagues recently 
suggested that someone could be fitted with a cochlear implant (devices that convert sound waves into electronic impulses and enable the deaf to hear) and a 
skull-mounted micro- chip that converts brain waves into words (a prototype is under research).
Then, if both devices were connected to a wireless network, we really would have arrived at the point which science fiction writers have been getting excited 
about for years. Mind reading!
He was joking, but for how long the gag remains funny is far from clear.
Today's technology is already producing a marked shift in the way we think and behave, particularly among the young.
I mustn't, however, be too censorious, because what I'm talking about is pleasure. For some, pleasure means wine, women and song; for others, more recently, 
sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll; and for millions today, endless hours at the computer console.
But whatever your particular variety of pleasure (and energetic sport needs to be added to the list), it's long been accepted that 'pure' pleasure - that is to 
say, activity during which you truly "let yourself go" - was part of the diverse portfolio of normal human life. Until now, that is.
Now, coinciding with the moment when technology and pharmaceutical companies are finding ever more ways to have a direct influence on the human brain, pleasure 
is becoming the sole be-all and end-all of many lives, especially among the young.
We could be raising a hedonistic generation who live only in the thrill of the computer-generated moment, and are in distinct danger of detaching themselves 
from what the rest of us would consider the real world.
This is a trend that worries me profoundly. For as any alcoholic or drug addict will tell you, nobody can be trapped in the moment of pleasure forever. Sooner 
or later, you have to come down.
I'm certainly not saying all video games are addictive (as yet, there is not enough research to back that up), and I genuinely welcome the new generation of 
"brain-training" computer games aimed at keeping the little grey cells active for longer.
As my Alzheimer's research has shown me, when it comes to higher brain function, it's clear that there is some truth in the adage "use it or lose it".
However, playing certain games can mimic addiction, and that the heaviest users of these games might soon begin to do a pretty good impersonation of an addict.
Throw in circumstantial evidence that links a sharp rise in diagnoses of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and the associated three-fold increase in 
Ritalin prescriptions over the past ten years with the boom in computer games and you have an immensely worrying scenario.
But we mustn't be too pessimistic about the future. It may sound frighteningly Orwellian, but there may be some potential advantages to be gained from our 
growing understanding of the human brain's tremendous plasticity. What if we could create an environment that would allow the brain to develop in a way that 
was seen to be of universal benefit?
I'm not convinced that scientists will ever find a way of manipulating the brain to make us all much cleverer (it would probably be cheaper and far more 
effective to manipulate the education system). And nor do I believe that we can somehow be made much happier - not, at least, without somehow anaesthetising 
ourselves against the sadness and misery that is part and parcel of the human condition.
When someone I love dies, I still want to be able to cry.
But I do, paradoxically, see potential in one particular direction. I think it possible that we might one day be able to harness outside stimuli in such a way 
that creativity - surely the ultimate expression of individuality - is actually boosted rather than diminished.
I am optimistic and excited by what future research will reveal into the workings of the human brain, and the extraordinary process by which it is translated 
into a uniquely individual mind.
But I'm also concerned that we seem to be so oblivious to the dangers that are already upon us.
Well, that debate must start now. Identity, the very essence of what it is to be human, is open to change - both good and bad. Our children, and certainly our 
grandchildren, will not thank us if we put off discussion much longer.
OnOctober 9, 2019 — Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year — a young white man attempted to enter a synagogue in Halle, Germany, with what appeared to 
be at least six homemade firearms while livestreaming via the gaming platform Twitch. Unable to enter the building, which had about 80 people inside, the man 
began shooting on the street, killing two and injuring two others. The gunman was a 27-year-old right-wing extremist with anti-Semitic and far-right views who 
had outlined his beliefs in a “manifesto” he uploaded online shortly before attempting to enter the synagogue. During the confusion following the attack, news 
outlets reported he had committed the atrocity using a 3D-printed gun.
The idea of a mass shooter using 3D printing technology shocked and intrigued those following the developing story from afar. U.K. newspaper The Independent 
cautioned, “Use of 3D printed guns in German synagogue shooting must act as a warning to security services, experts say,” while the Wall Street Journal 
screamed, “Is 3-D Printing the Future of Terrorism?”
The threat of the 3D-printed gun has loomed large in the American imagination for nearly a decade. In 2013, Cody Wilson, the founder of Defense Distributed — 
an open-source collective devoted to developing printable guns — unveiled plans for the world’s first entirely 3D-printed gun: The “Liberator,” a 
clunky-looking, single-shot, plastic beige handgun named in honor of the FP-45 Liberator, a pistol that U.S. soldiers dropped behind enemy lines to resistance 
fighters in Nazi-occupied territories during World War II. Shortly after Wilson released the files online, the State Department forced him to take them down, 
jump-starting a debate over guns, gun control, and free speech that continues to pop up whenever 3D-printed firearms are mentioned. Wilson wasn’t penalized for 
making his Liberator prototype, though; the feds only swooped in once he shared the blueprints online.
It turned out that news reports had overstated the Halle gunman’s weapons; he hadn’t used a 3D-printed gun like the fully plastic, single-shot Liberator. 
Researchers at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College London confirmed that the two firearms used had only been partially 
constructed with the 3D-printed parts of a trigger clip and torch barrel attachment on a Luty submachine gun and a shell holder attachment on a shotgun.
According to his writing online, the Halle gunman had held a longtime interest in homemade weapons and had written in his manifesto that he’d wanted to take 
this opportunity to demonstrate their viability. Fortunately, both of the weapons he used malfunctioned at least three times, leading the gunman to yelp in 
frustration on his livestream, “I have certainly managed to prove how absurd improvised weapons are!”
3D-printed guns fall into the larger category of homemade firearms, known colloquially as “ghost guns” — an established, if slightly niche, part of gun 
culture, especially in America. The U.S. is home to a long tradition of DIY gunsmithing that stretches back to the Colonial era, when local blacksmiths forged 
musket barrels as well as horseshoes. Eli Whitney, the inventor of the cotton gin, also pioneered the “interchangeable parts” method of production, which was 
used by legions of individual craftsmen to manufacture thousands of muskets during the 1790s.
Thanks to the Second Amendment, there are few paths to regulate or legislate ghost guns out of existence, and cracking down on 3D printing will only do so much.
Ghost guns have risen in popularity thanks in part to the 2004 expiration of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which had prohibited U.S. residents from 
owning different kinds of assault weapons as well as various types of large-capacity magazines. Most modern firearms hobbyists have since taken to using parts 
kits, which are easily attainable through internet retailers. There are a number of varieties on offer, from Glock handguns to classic 1911 pistols to more 
advanced weaponry. The one thing all of these homemade firearms have in common — from the rudimentary to the cutting edge — is that they are untraceable, 
untrackable, and, provided one follows a few cursory rules, completely legal under U.S. federal law.
For those wishing to make their own AR-15 rifles, the most important DIY component is its lower receiver, which connects the stock, barrel, magazine, and other 
parts. After the assault weapons ban expired, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said that it would no longer characterize an AR-15 
receiver as a firearm as long as the trigger cavity was not yet milled out. This small distinction made it legal for online retailers to sell as many 
80%-completed AR-15 receivers — as well as other varieties and accessories — as they liked. With the right tools, some basic know-how, and a little bit of 
old-fashioned elbow grease, anyone can make their own unregistered AR-15 rifle sans background check, sans waiting period, and sans government oversight.
Ghost guns periodically end up in the news and tend to trigger a chain reaction of intrigue and horror when they do. The primary sticking point for people 
seems to be their untraceable, unregistered aspect; law enforcement issues dire warnings about “criminals” using them for nefarious means, and the gun-control 
advocates who push for more firearms regulation are understandably alarmed by their existence. Add 3D-printing to that equation — a technology that essentially 
allows a person to create an object out of thin air — and you’ve got a recipe for public concern.
In March of this year, Defense Distributed relaunched DEFCAD, a massive online library of downloadable design files that, for an annual fee, are available to 
all U.S. residents. President Donald Trump expressed momentary interest in 3D gun blueprints in 2018, and his administration has attempted to transfer 
regulation of these guns away from the State Department, which would allow for broader distribution. A number of state attorneys asked the Trump administration 
to crack down on the site immediately after it went live, but as of now, DEFCAD remains victorious — and currently boasts over 23,000 registered users.
Yet for all the hubbub around Wilson’s Liberator, it is still a clunky, goofy-looking, single-shot gun — more of a political statement than a functional 
weapon. While the impact Wilson and Defense Distributed have had on the field is insurmountable, they’re no longer the only game in town. For better or worse, 
thousands of people are now getting in on the ghost gun action using 3D printing — fashioning parts instead of an entire plastic gun. Even before the 
coronavirus pandemic sent sales of parts kits skyrocketing, these untraceable weapons were exploding in popularity. In 2019, D.C. police seized 116 ghost guns; 
in 2018, the number was 25; in 2017, they seized three.
Thanks to the Second Amendment, there are few paths to regulate or legislate ghost guns out of existence, and cracking down on 3D printing will only do so 
much, especially at a time when the technology is enjoying an upswing in popularity due to its efficacy in churning out personal protective equipment. 
3D-printed guns aren’t the stuff of science-fiction nightmares — they’re already here.
InOctober 2017, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke at a VIP-laden press event in Toronto to announce plans for a new neighborhood in the city to be 
built “from the internet up.” The big reveal was the builder: Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet, the parent company of Google. The mood was festive, 
optimistic. Schoolchildren were on hand with Lego models of future cityscapes, which Trudeau, flanked by Eric Schmidt, Alphabet’s then–executive chairman, and 
John Tory, the Toronto mayor, explored in a flawlessly staged photo op.
The prime minister spoke in earnest tones. Quayside, as the 12-acre waterfront project had been christened, would be “a testbed for new technologies,” he said, 
“that will help us build smarter, greener, more inclusive cities.” Not one to shy away from wholesome platitudes, he added, “The future, just like this 
community, will be interconnected.”
Then Schmidt rose to the lectern and said that Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin had long opined about “all of these things that we could do if 
someone would just give us a city and put us in charge.” Chuckles reverberated through the crowd.
News that Alphabet had leaped neck deep into the smart city business lit up tech media for weeks. Sidewalk Labs’ renderings for the project — autonomous carts 
delivering packages and hauling away waste maneuvered in underground tunnels, while barefoot kids, butterflies, and birds cavorted in a 
Jetsons-meets-organic-living neighborhood at street level — flashed across the internet. Local news stations covered the project dotingly, picking up the 
Sidewalk Labs talking point that a network of sensors and other IT infrastructure embedded in the community would enable a new era of urban efficiency. Homes 
and workplaces in Quayside would “study occupants’ behavior while they’re inside them to make life easier,” said a reporter on one evening broadcast after the 
press event. Quayside would be “the first neighborhood of its kind,” he said, and — as if one superlative wasn’t enough — it would be “a community like none 
other.”
Sidewalk Labs’ rosy vision for Quayside, however, will not come to be. In May, the company announced it was abandoning the project, citing economic 
infeasibility. But what wasn’t mentioned was that the project had also become politically infeasible. The Quayside announcement inspired a groundswell of 
resistance, first among civil liberties activists, and then, eventually, among the ranks of Canada’s most prominent businesspeople, local civic leaders, and 
Toronto residents. Objections ranged from fears of Orwellian surveillance to Canadians’ general skepticism of the American culture of exceptionalism, so 
perfectly embodied by a Silicon Valley–designed smart city.
The Quayside vision was born at the peak of the tech giants’ cultural prowess. Today, the era of techno-optimism seems all but dead. The demise of the most 
ambitious smart city project in North America, backed by one of the most powerful corporations on the planet, came at the hands of a small group of Toronto 
activists — and one disaffected tech billionaire. The story of their battle is a parable, not just for the smart city movement, but also for a growing sense 
that the tech industry, with its promise of data-driven solutions to structural and institutional problems, won’t save us.
Sidewalk Labs was founded in 2015 by Dan Doctoroff, a former Wall Street analyst and private equity managing partner who served as a deputy mayor of New York 
under Michael Bloomberg. Billed as an “urban innovation” startup and armed with the deep pockets of its parent company, Sidewalk Labs has incubated two urban 
planning tools and spun off a few subsidiaries of its own. Those include Coord, which sells curb management software to municipal governments, and Cityblock, 
which establishes health care clinics in low-income neighborhoods. Prior to Quayside, Sidewalk Labs’ most public-facing project was LinkNYC, a series of 
curbside kiosks across New York City’s five boroughs that provide free Wi-Fi and broadcast ads on their 55-inch screens — all while collecting a variety of 
data with the three cameras and 30 sensors housed in each kiosk.
But Quayside was to be the company’s magnum opus: transforming what had previously been an area east of downtown Toronto characterized by desolate parking lots 
and the graffiti-strewn foundations of demolished buildings into a living laboratory for an urban future in which technology would be embedded in every nook 
and cranny.
On one level, the vision was gadgety: Park benches might count how many people came to sit on them each hour, and curbside trash cans could alert the 
sanitation department when they were full. But the plans laid out in Sidewalk Labs’ initial proposal were far more comprehensive, encompassing an integrated 
digital layer for the full gamut of civic services, including urban planning, mass transit, road infrastructure, utility systems, social services, even health 
care. In a blog post, a Toronto tech entrepreneur who had interviewed for a job with the company said he was asked for his ideas about integrating technology 
with voting systems. Ultimately, the company hoped to develop a sort of urban operating system that could then be exported to other cities. Trudeau said he 
envisioned the technology spreading beyond Quayside across Toronto’s eastern waterfront and, ultimately, to “other parts of Canada and around the world.”
In October 2017, Sidewalk Labs signed an initial agreement with Waterfront Toronto, an agency with a 25-year mandate to redevelop 2,000 acres of the city’s 
downtown lakefront. Charged with overseeing some of the most strategic real estate in Canada, it is almost a government of its own, with the municipal, 
provincial, and federal governments each appointing four board members and asserting equal control over its affairs. The contract stipulated a period of 
planning and public engagement (originally set for one year, but later extended amid mounting resistance), during which input on the project would be sought.
I attended one of these meetings. Swarms of Sidewalk Labs employees — young, energetic, and dressed in blue T-shirts — milled around answering questions and 
hyping the project. A similar vibe filled a defunct fish processing plant adjacent to the Quayside site where the company set up an office with an attached 
visitor center of sorts. Painted the same blue as the Sidewalk Labs T-shirts, the visitor center showcased some of the flashier technologies proposed for 
Quayside, such as “building raincoats” that could spring out from a facade to make outdoor space more usable in inclement weather, and street pavers with 
embedded lights that would heat the pavement and could act as changeable lane markings. In conjunction with autonomous vehicle technology, these could allow 
lanes to shift according to real-time traffic flow. There were also boards where visitors could leave messages. Suspicion of the project emerged early. When I 
visited, the boards were heavy on criticism. “Is Google Big Brother now?” asked one commenter.
The backlash to Sidewalk Labs’ Quayside project began almost as soon as Trudeau left the stage of the announcement event. Two weeks later, at the first 
community meeting for the project, anti-gentrification protesters gathered outside, while inside, a Q&A session with Doctoroff was at times confrontational. 
After he used the word “platform” to describe Sidewalk Labs’ venture in Toronto, one audience member rose to the microphone to express his concern.
“So, I’m just really curious,” he said, as to whether Doctoroff had any thoughts about “the power and wealth concentration that happens with platform 
ventures?” The crowd applauded.
“That is a fabulous question,” Doctoroff replied. “It’s a hard question to answer,” he continued, “but I will tell you that amongst ourselves we’ve talked 
about sort of different models of governance and ownership.” The intention, Doctoroff said, was for the Sidewalk Labs platform to be “open” to IT developers to 
“build things on top of it” — Google’s Android operating system is open in this way — “where, at the end of the day, they’ll be the beneficiaries of their 
intellectual capital and hard work, and not the platform itself.”
But with all the talk of sensors and data collection, it was privacy advocates who formed the largest and loudest contingent of skeptics.
Sidewalk Labs, no doubt anticipating this criticism, had retained the former information and privacy commissioner of Ontario, Ann Cavoukian, PhD, as a 
consultant-slash-surrogate. The month after the announcement, Cavoukian appeared on The Agenda, a popular Canadian talk show, along with Bianca Wylie, a 
Toronto activist and self-described “open government advocate” who was quickly emerging as the leading critic of the project. “The ability to track citizens, 
to engage in surveillance with the technology that they’re proposing — that’s not going to happen,” Cavoukian told listeners. “I can provide that assurance.”
But Wylie was dubious of the assurances of a paid consultant, and particularly concerned with the collection of “aggregate data… how the city is working, where 
people are using things, what the transportation flow is like.” She continued, “If a company is taking that data and using it to build products and services to 
then sell back to us, why isn’t that intellectual property and the value of that data ours as residents of the city?” She pointed out that tech companies’ 
plans for data collection in public space far outpaced citizens’ ability to comprehend the implications, much less governments’ ability to regulate the 
fast-growing smart city industry.
Wylie’s biggest fear about Quayside, however, was that Sidewalk Labs’ profiteering would come at the expense of democracy. Sidewalk Labs’ proposal encompassed 
many of the functions of municipal government, but without the accountability we expect from elected officials. Just as Google monopolizes search, critics 
feared a similar scenario in the smart city market. They argued that data collected in public space, where opting out isn’t an option, would herald a new age 
of surveillance. And the agreement between Toronto and Sidewalk Labs was proceeding without a single vote from a local resident.
“It is not innovative to be partnering with, basically, a monopoly,” Wylie told listeners. Cavoukian furrowed her brow. The show’s other guest, a former 
architecture critic at the Toronto Star and a Sidewalk Labs supporter, looked perplexed. Besides, said Wylie, the most intractable urban problems won’t be 
solved by Silicon Valley giants throwing technology at them. “Is A.I. and technology going to help us have a more equitable city?” she asked, cautioning 
against “tech solutionism.”
The first wave of pushback against Sidewalk Labs had a grassroots, down-with-capitalism vibe — edgy, left-leaning urban affairs publications like Spacing 
churned out one skeptical story after another. Torontoist hosted a crowdsourced list of questions for Sidewalk Labs, which were mostly unanswered. But soon 
other voices, including from the C-suite, chimed in.
On a snowy night in 2018, I sat in a leather armchair aboard a private jet en route from Washington, D.C., to Waterloo, Ontario. Across from me was billionaire 
philanthropist Jim Balsillie, the former co-CEO and co-chairman of Research in Motion, the Waterloo company that created BlackBerry phones. Tall and athletic, 
Balsillie has a reputation in Canadian business circles as a reserved but forceful character known to berate those who he disagrees with. For nearly two 
decades, Google had been a thorn in Balsillie’s side. Though it was the iPhone that first dethroned the BlackBerry from the top of the smartphone market, 
Android — used in a huge number of phones across price points — cemented BlackBerry’s descent into tech’s history bin. After several years of trying to keep 
the BlackBerry afloat, Balsillie retired from the board in 2012 and devoted himself to making the Canadian tech industry more competitive with Silicon Valley.
Everything about the Quayside project made Balsillie furious. First off, despite the fact that at least one Canadian consortium was shortlisted to compete with 
Sidewalk Labs for the bid, a U.S. company had ultimately been selected. Balsillie also held special ire for Waterfront Toronto and its then CEO, Will Fleissig, 
an American architect and real estate developer.
Balsillie described Waterfront Toronto leadership to me, variously, as “naive,” “insecure,” and “treasonous.” As the nation’s leading tech figure, he was 
brought on by the agency in 2018 as an informal adviser for the Quayside project, despite his hostility. I asked how that was going. “It’s going good,” he 
said, with a wry grin. “There’s a little run on Alka-Seltzer at the local pharmacy every time we have our chitty-chat.”
Just as the Sidewalk Labs project was taking shape, Balsillie was undergoing something of an ideological transformation. A longtime defender of the Canadian 
tech industry, he was evolving from a tech evangelist to tech reformist. Balsillie is a friend and collaborator of billionaire investor George Soros, and the 
two share a similar outlook of the tech industry. In a January 2018 speech in Davos, Soros characterized companies like Google and Facebook as a “menace” to 
democracy. “There could be an alliance between authoritarian states and these large data-rich IT monopolies that would bring together nascent systems of 
corporate surveillance with an already developing system of state-sponsored surveillance,” Soros said. “This may well result in a web of totalitarian control 
the likes of which not even Aldous Huxley or George Orwell could have imagined.”
In early 2018, Balsillie also began to speak out aggressively against the tech industry. Testifying in Ottawa at a hearing about the Cambridge Analytica 
scandal in May that year, he told members of a parliamentary committee that “Facebook and Google are companies built exclusively on the principle of mass 
surveillance.” The danger of partnering with foreign companies like Sidewalk Labs was that “our data is subject to foreign laws, making Canada a client state,” 
he’d said.
“The ability to track citizens, to engage in surveillance with the technology that they’re proposing — that’s not going to happen”
Balsillie was also taking his grievances to the world stage. The night I joined him on his jet, he was flying home after giving a speech at the International 
Monetary Fund headquarters, just a few blocks from the White House. He’d told the roomful of economists that the prosperity of the 20th century, based 
primarily on the trade of tangible goods, had “created rising tides that lifted all boats.” But the rise of the intangibles economy, as he put it, driven by 
the battle to monopolize data, “lifts mostly a few yachts.” He spoke from experience.
Over the course of the project’s first year, the media narrative shifted from doting to questioning. One of the most inflammatory headlines came from an 
October 2018 op-ed Balsillie wrote in the Globe and Mail. Quayside “is not a smart city,” but a “pseudo-tech dystopia,” he wrote. “It is a colonizing 
experiment in surveillance capitalism attempting to bulldoze important urban, civic and political issues.” In another op-ed earlier that year, he blamed the 
situation on lawmakers’ “colonial supplicant attitude” toward the United States. Canada, he wrote, was at risk of “becoming not just a cheap tech branch plant 
economy… but also a client-state, politically and militarily subordinate.”
The project polarized Canadians between those who wanted elected officials to show Sidewalk Labs the door and those who thought the first camp was paranoid and 
unreasonable. Waterfront Toronto fell under immense pressure and promised more public meetings for residents to voice their concerns. In November 2018, just 
over a year after the project was first announced, Sidewalk Labs staff gave a slideshow to Alphabet about the headwinds they faced in Toronto. “The majority of 
the negative press coverage is rooted in an anti-global tech giant narrative being spun by… Jim Balsillie,” said the presentation, which was later leaked to 
the press.
While Sidewalk Labs mounted a massive PR campaign to garner public support — alongside an extensive though more discreet lobbying campaign in the halls of 
power — Balsillie leveraged his contacts within the Canadian political and business establishment to build opposition. By the winter of 2018, Toronto city 
council members began voicing concerns. A report from the National Research Council from December 2017, which journalists uncovered in June 2018, said that 
Canada was in danger of becoming a “data cow” for foreign tech platforms (though Sidewalk Labs was not explicitly mentioned). And Trudeau came under fire for 
appearing, in critics’ eyes, as more sympathetic to Silicon Valley interests than to Canadians’ — to the point of corruption, some believed.

Many of those allegations were rooted in the original bidding process for the Quayside project. Though the Quayside project was open to bids from any qualified 
party, Trudeau’s language during the October press event suggested that the winner had been predetermined. “Eric and I have been talking about collaborating on 
this for a few years now, and seeing it all come together is extraordinarily exciting,” said Trudeau, speaking of Eric Schmidt, the Alphabet chairman. A 
spokeswoman for the prime minister told me that the comment referred to a general intent to collaborate and was not in reference to the Sidewalk Labs project 
in particular, but doubts lingered.
Further raising eyebrows, the press conference took place one day after the Waterfront Toronto board voted to approve their initial agreement with Sidewalk 
Labs, a complex legal document the board was given just the weekend to review. But the press conference looked meticulously arranged: In addition to the kids 
and their Legos, a slick promo video featuring staff of both Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalk Labs was screened. Did they pull that together the afternoon 
before? Did the VIPs from Ottawa and Silicon Valley drop everything to fly in on less than a day’s notice? Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalk Labs officials have 
insisted there were no improprieties in the selection process and assured me that the event would have been called off had the board not voted yes.
But Julie Di Lorenzo, a Waterfront Toronto board member who resigned in June 2018 in protest over elements of the Sidewalk Labs project, said the deal was 
“jammed inappropriately on the board with no time to review.”
In October 2018, Charlie Angus, a member of Canadian Parliament who was on the committee investigating Cambridge Analytica, sent a letter to Trudeau’s 
infrastructure minister, urging the government to “hit the pause button” on the Quayside project. “Data-opolies like Google have done little to reassure the 
public that they can be trusted without strong regulatory oversight,” he wrote. Moving forward without a more robust policy framework in place would risk 
“creating a 21st century company town,” he added — “a privatized surveillance city.” Angus, a member of the New Democratic Party, which leans left of Trudeau’s 
Liberal Party, also issued a statement a month later accusing the administration of being in bed with Alphabet, citing two government officials who had 
recently taken jobs with Sidewalk Labs. “This unhealthy culture of coziness between the Liberal government and Sidewalk/Google is not in the public interest,” 
wrote Angus, a former bass player who was once described in a National Post article as a “socialist punk rocker with a big heart.”
Then, in December 2018, the Ontario Auditor General published the results of a damning investigation into Waterfront Toronto’s handling of Quayside. Unearthed 
emails showed that the agency was already discussing a project with Sidewalk Labs in 2016 and that board members had been “urged — strongly” to approve the 
deal. One email even speculated about the fallout that might occur from Sidewalk Labs’ intent to “control ALL data.”
“It’s obvious the fix was in for Google,” Angus told me when I spoke to him at the time.
Three Waterfront Toronto board members were fired in the aftermath of the investigation. In addition to Di Lorenzo, several members of a panel of experts 
convened to advise the agency on the project had departed, along with Will Fleissig, the agency’s CEO, who left in mid-2018.
Even Ann Cavoukian, the Sidewalk Labs consultant who sparred with Wylie on The Agenda, switched camps. Upon tendering her resignation, she said, “I wanted this 
to become a smart city of privacy — not a smart city of surveillance.”
While the pro-Sidewalk and anti-Sidewalk camps fought a war of words in the press, most residents remained in favor of the project through early 2019. I lived 
in Toronto throughout this period, and many of my acquaintances found the talk about a surveillance state at Quayside a tad conspiracy theoryish. A poll in 
early February 2019 revealed that 55% of 600 Toronto residents supported the project, while only 11% were opposed. For critics of the project, this reflected a 
public ill-equipped to understand what a 12-acre futuristic neighborhood had to do with the future of democracy. A group of Toronto activists set out to 
educate them.
On a cold, windy night around this time, I arrived at the Toronto Media Arts Centre, in the city’s trendy West Queen West neighborhood, for a workshop billed 
as a “design jam” on the theme of “What is data?” meant to enlighten citizens to how data can be used and misused. I overheard conversations about the 
mountains of genetic data being amassed by ancestry websites and how Facebook maintains “shadow profiles.” Facilitators offered tricks for keeping the data 
overlords at bay. Pizza and art materials were provided.
The workshop was put on by the Digital Justice Lab, a group formed during Toronto’s Quayside crucible whose initiatives included a project to teach data 
literacy and a series of BIPOC-only events. Digital Justice Lab had an early partnership with an organization founded by Balsillie. “The idea is to build 
community capacity around digital rights,” said Digital Justice Lab’s founder Nasma Ahmed, the young woman at the workshop who sat behind a sticker-plastered 
laptop wearing a black head wrap, horn-rimmed glasses, and a nose ring. “People don’t even have the language to have a public conversation around data 
practices, privacy, smart cities.”
Scandalous headlines about the Quayside project kept coming. On Valentine’s Day 2019, news broke that the company’s plans for Toronto were more extensive than 
had been disclosed. The company had previously floated the idea that the Quayside project could be expanded to the Port Lands, an adjacent 800-plus acres of 
derelict industrial land that is among the largest, most desirable undeveloped tracts of urban real estate in North America. The idea had been met with stiff 
resistance across the city — the Port Lands are nearly the equivalent of the city’s downtown core — and Sidewalk Labs had been forced to retreat from the idea. 
But documents obtained by the Toronto Star suggested that Sidewalk Labs was still negotiating for 350 of those acres, news that galvanized a large segment of 
residents.
About two weeks later, Ahmed joined Wylie and about 30 other community leaders, activists, and academics to launch the #BlockSidewalk campaign, the first 
coordinated effort to terminate the project. Ana Serrano, the president and vice chancellor of the Ontario College of Art and Design University and one of the 
group’s original members, described #BlockSidewalk as “a citizen-run volunteer organization that came together organically after the news of the land grab.” 
She told me recently, “It became clear for many in Toronto at that time, regardless of their background, that there needed to be some form of democratic 
process around how we build out that land.”
In June 2019, after several delays, Sidewalk Labs presented its much-anticipated master plan for Quayside. The 1,500-page plan — worth at least $2.9 billion in 
real estate and development projects — walked back the Port Lands expansion from 350 to 190 acres. In addition to building raincoats and tunnels for autonomous 
trash collection carts, a green energy system was proposed. The buildings would be constructed largely with mass timber — a compression of multiple wood pieces 
that can sequester carbon, considered a cutting-edge technology for structures more than a few stories tall — and Sidewalk Labs would fund a special factory to 
provide it. Great pains were taken to address concerns about data governance: Sidewalk Labs proposed that an independent “data trust” be established, a 
watchdog of sorts, to oversee the collection and management of all data collected, and the company again swore never to sell personal data, use it for ads, or 
monetize it in any way.
The plan was an olive branch to naysayers but did little to quell the rising tide of criticism. That spring, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association helped 
file a lawsuit against Waterfront Toronto, which alleged that the data collection proposed by Sidewalk Labs would infringe on constitutional rights. 
“Non-consensual surrender by the state to Sidewalk Labs and/or others of private data” could inhibit free speech and public assembly, the lawsuit said. “This 
curtails or negates critical freedoms in a democracy where collective behavior plays an important political and social role.”
The same day the master plan was released, the new board chair of Waterfront Toronto, Stephen Diamond, who had been appointed with a mandate to put the company 
on a shorter leash, issued an open letter stating that the master plan had to be dialed back even further. If Sidewalk Labs was unwilling to do so, the 
negotiations would be terminated. “The city of Toronto could get by without Sidewalk Labs, to be quite frank,” Diamond said that fall.
The activism — both at the grassroots level and top-down messaging from Balsillie — was working. A month after the master plan came out, a new poll showed that 
four times as many residents were now opposed to the project than just a few months earlier. Six out of 10 respondents said they did not trust Sidewalk Labs to 
collect data, with a similar number expressing doubt that the company would honor its pledge to not use data for advertising.
On Halloween 2019, Waterfront Toronto agreed to the new terms presented by Sidewalk Labs for the project. The scope would be reset to the original 12 acres. 
Data would be stored in Canada and subject to domestic law. Infrastructure development would be controlled by the agency rather than the company. And the 
government would “be entitled to a revenue stream on products and services piloted in Waterfront Toronto-facilitated testbeds, based on global net revenues.” 
Sidewalk Labs was given several months to revise its plan according to the new terms — Quayside was alive, but on life support.
As2020 dawned, it seemed unclear whether Sidewalk Labs leadership was indeed willing to squish their lofty ambitions into those increasingly constricted 12 
acres. Sidewalk Labs and Waterfront Toronto both declined interview requests, but Helen Burstyn, the former Waterfront Toronto board chair who was one of the 
three board members fired by the province after the 2018 investigation, offered an inside perspective on negotiations between the two parties. While the agency 
attempted to maintain an appearance of unity with the company early on, Burstyn said that behind the scenes, the relationship was fraught from day one.
“There were a lot of things we [the board] were not comfortable with,” Burstyn told me recently, citing complaints from Sidewalk Labs “about how slow and 
bureaucratic we were. We can be, but we believe in good governance. Canadians are regulators, and our governments are very attuned to their responsibility — 
they didn’t realize how American they were in their approach.” The company was told, “You’re just going to have to live with it,” Burstyn said. “Sidewalk never 
fully appreciated that. They were always pushing for more.”
Many critics blamed Waterfront Toronto for a failure to rein in Sidewalk Labs, but Burstyn claims the agency’s intentions were more closely aligned with the 
naysayers than the naysayers realized. “I don’t disagree with anything that Jim Balsillie said. I just don’t like the way he said it,” Burstyn explained. “It 
wasn’t necessary to be insulting to the intelligence or integrity of people who actually do regulate these things.” She discounted theories about the 
government influencing the selection of Sidewalk Labs. “It became seen by some as sinister and prebaked,” she said, “but I don’t think that was actually the 
case.”
Burstyn argues that ultimately, she was fired as a sacrifice in order to move forward with the project. “It was a symbol. They had to do something, so they got 
rid of us. The well had been poisoned.”
“It was a symbol. They had to do something, so they got rid of us. The well had been poisoned”
To anyone paying attention, the writing was on the wall. Anthony Townsend, author of Smart Cities: Big Data, Civic Hackers, and the Quest for a New Utopia, 
worked as a consultant for Sidewalk Labs in 2015 and 2016. He is a proponent of smart cities, but as someone who studies the intersections of technology and 
urban planning, he is keenly aware that the cultures surrounding those professions do not always gel. Townsend told me he eventually walked away when his 
contract expired, in part due to philosophical disagreements with senior leadership. “Their lack of serious thinking about privacy and data governance had been 
a major concern of mine when I was there,” Townsend told me. “I pushed that agenda, but they didn’t see it as a priority.”
Townsend accused Sidewalk Labs of hubris. He said company leadership was largely stocked by people from Michael Bloomberg’s orbit, which created another sort 
of cultural schism. “They had a reputation for being too smart for themselves in New York, so when they got to Toronto, where the culture is much less brash 
and aggressive, they came off as doubly so.” Sidewalk Labs CEO Doctoroff is a “dyed-in-the-wool Wall Street guy,” said Townsend, adding that the company lacked 
a “participatory design approach” for Quayside. “It was a very, very top-down exercise. It’s inevitable today that those kinds of projects get rejected.”
I’d spoken with Doctoroff in December 2018 and asked him about one of the detractors’ top complaints: that Sidewalk Labs had not been transparent about its 
business model. He told me that Balsillie’s rhetoric about commercializing citizens’ data was “ridiculous” and “in bad faith.” While Doctoroff acknowledged 
that Sidewalk Labs hoped to generate revenue from “new technologies” developed in Toronto, he declined to elaborate when I pressed him for details.
The business model, he told me, was to “improve urban life” and to “be a catalyst in the creation of hopefully something extraordinary on the waterfront.” 
Doctoroff grew animated when I pointed out that this sounded more like a marketing pitch than a business model. It seemed reasonable to assume data would play 
a role in the technologies Sidewalk Labs was developing. “That is absolutely false!” he said, raising his voice. “Do not paint us with this brush because of 
our affiliation [with Google].” Sidewalk Labs, he said, “is not first and foremost about making money.”
The Waterfront Toronto board scheduled a final vote on Sidewalk Labs’ revised plan for June this year. But the vote never happened. On a cool spring day in 
early May, Wylie was sitting in her living room when she heard the news: Sidewalk Labs was pulling out. She ran upstairs to her family, shouting, “It’s over! 
It’s over!” she told me recently. “My kids were like, what’s wrong? I was like, no, it’s good!” For more than two and a half years, Wylie had devoted her life 
to the cause. “I was making calls and sending emails right up until this happened,” she said. “It was a major relief. I almost forgot what it felt like to not 
have to worry about it all the time.”
Sidewalk Labs cited the current economic climate as the catalyst for their decision. “I think Covid was the excuse, but their leaving was inevitable,” Burstyn 
told me. “I’m surprised it took them that long.”
Waterfront Toronto has been mum on its next steps for Quayside, but in an email, a spokesman said that “building a next generation community” remains “a key 
deliverable” for the agency. “While our long-term goal remains the same, we will take the time necessary to determine what our next steps will be,” he wrote. 
Before Waterfront Toronto embarks anew to develop “innovative and world-class solutions to urban challenges in a post-pandemic world,” he continued, “we will 
need to evaluate which of our original goals are consistent with these new realities.”
Burstyn was more circumspect in her assessment of Toronto’s smart city future. Post-Covid-19, would a hyperfuturistic development remain a priority? “Forget 
it,” she said. “I think we’re at a point where nobody is going to dream big. We’re going to dream practical.” Affordable housing was a top concern among 
Toronto residents before the pandemic, and in the economic fallout it will only grow as a priority, she said, as an example.
The rise and fall of Quayside coincides with the slow scaling back of other ambitious smart city ventures, such as Masdar City in Abu Dhabi and Songdo near 
Seoul, Townsend said. “All these smart city megaprojects are now fairly conventional real estate projects.” Perhaps the barriers to melding cyberspace with 
physical space are taller than the techno-optimists realized.
Townsend, however, thinks the pandemic will accelerate the transition of internet technology from screens to the real world. Existing trends like telework and 
the shift to e-commerce suddenly seem deeply entrenched — changes in urban infrastructure are inevitable as a result, he said, and that new reality will likely 
be more automated. “We’re fast-forwarding five to 10 years into the digital future,” Townsend said. “So, all the dilemmas that people like Bianca Wylie have 
been raising alarm bells about” — he refers to Wylie as the Jane Jacobs of smart cities — “will become urgent issues that large numbers of people are going to 
be directly affected by. Once the public health situation stabilizes, hopefully we will see more effort put into dealing with all the scary sides of the 
surveillance state that we’re building.”
Perhaps the barriers to melding cyberspace with physical space are taller than the techno-optimists realized
The pandemic has introduced a new suite of data collection concerns — contact tracing apps, temperature scanning as a condition to enter restaurants, biometric 
identity verification at airports. Wylie worries the public is accepting these technologies as emergency measures, and without the realization that once such 
architecture is in place, it may be repurposed down the road for less noble purposes — such as the developing surveillance apparatus in China that critics fear 
spreading into the world’s weakened democracies. Wylie is now a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a think tank founded by 
Balsillie. “Thank god for Bianca Wylie,” Balsillie said the first time I met him, referring to her as “a hero.”
Less than a week after announcing Sidewalk Labs’ withdrawal from Toronto, Doctoroff participated in a webinar organized by the Urban Land Institute in which he 
contemplated the post-Covid-19 future of smart cities. The webinar is not publicly accessible, but according to an Urban Land Institute blog post about it, the 
company plans to apply the research and development that was underway for the Quayside project elsewhere — in places “where they’re committed to a heavy dose 
of innovation,” said Doctoroff, according to the blog post. Following their departure from Toronto, “we’ve been overwhelmed with interest from all over the 
world,” he added. Perhaps the smart city is not dead, but simply in the bardo, on its way to being reborn.
Doctoroff seemed to paint the very picture Wylie fears. According to the blog post, he “believes the crisis ultimately will create an even greater need for 
urban innovation — including the sort of data collection and analysis that had concerned some Toronto residents, which could become important tools for 
controlling the spread of future disease outbreaks akin to COVID-19.” The pandemic, then, could be a Trojan horse for data-gathering projects far beyond 
Sidewalk Lab’s wildest dreams for Quayside. Doctoroff likened it to New Yorkers who “adjusted to a network of surveillance cameras installed in lower Manhattan 
after the September 11 attacks.”
The public has grown far more sophisticated in its understanding of surveillance issues since then, however, and far more skeptical of the benevolent 
intentions of Silicon Valley. And with the defeat of Quayside, the activists, academics, and business elite that comprise the tech reform movement, if one 
could call it that, have a playbook for future battles.
Everything will change in six days, when George Floyd stops breathing under the knee of a white police officer. But for now, it is May 19, an ordinary day 
during a global pandemic, and Brianna Blackmon is just waking up in her bedroom in Columbia, South Carolina, where she lives with her boyfriend and their 
blue-nose pit bull, DJ.
Blackmon showers, carefully applies powder-blue eyeshadow in the bathroom mirror, and marbles her lips with a muted sparkle gloss. The shirt she picks out is a 
simple crop top, on which the phrase “More Self-Love” is printed. Blackmon is a 23-year-old musician who performs under the name BJ From the Burbs. After she 
finishes her morning routine, she walks into her home office to record a new freestyle. The space doubles as a makeshift studio, and today's session will be 
extra special. Once there, comfortably situated on the couch, Blackmon opens the TikTok app on her phone and taps Record.
The night before, Blackmon got word about Blackout Day, a demonstration of solidarity among Black users on TikTok who claim the platform is unfairly censoring 
them. To show unity, all creators were asked to switch their avatars to an image of a Black Power fist. She wants this freestyle to be her contribution. By the 
sixth take, Blackmon lands on a version she's happy with and uploads it to her 176,000 followers. Over a slow-building trap beat, she rides the bubbling 
momentum. “Black creators on this app have had enough,” she raps. “So we switched our pictures, put our fists up just to say what's up.” Before long, the 
53-second freestyle is doing numbers, making rounds on other users' personal feeds—the algorithmically driven For You pages. The praise floods in.
“Go awf,” comments @vixxienewell.
“YESS!!!” says @taylorcassidyj, one of the app's more visible Black creators.
“I have chills mama,” says @seiricean.
Adds @d_damodel: “Ayeeee ok ”
Blackmon uploads three more videos throughout the day. In one, she urges followers to donate “to the collection plate in my bio” (aka her CashApp). None of 
them performs quite as well as the initial freestyle, but she's satisfied and considers the day a win.
When Blackmon opens TikTok again the following morning—“to check my views,” she says—she realizes something has gone wrong. Her freestyle post is still there, 
but it's now silent. The audio has been completely removed. In her three months on the app, it's a first. “You know how you get an instinct where you're like, 
‘That's not right’?” Blackmon tells me in June, when we talk by phone. “That one did not sit well with my spirit.”
TikTok often mutes posts for violating its community guidelines, but Blackmon isn't told which guideline she violated. As is typical in these cases, she's 
given no explanation or notice of any kind. She reflects back on the video—no cursing, no hate speech, nothing too controversial. When she looks for a way to 
appeal the decision, she can't find one. She's left only with a suspicion, a taste of something bitter. “It's not just me,” Blackmon says. “They are picking on 
certain types of creators.”
The following day, sans makeup, Blackmon uploads another video, done in one off-the-cuff take. “Isn't this funny—TikTok doesn't silence Black creators?” she 
says in a mocking tone. “Then why did they take my sound down from my video, from my pro-Black rap that went viral yesterday? I wonder.” It was almost too 
absurd. Blackmon made a video protesting censorship—and was censored. Is this what it meant to be Black and unapologetic on TikTok?
TikTok has an irresistible draw. In my casual use, I often find myself spellbound by its gonzo humor and mini-blockbusters, full of conceptual daring. The 
app's directive, it seems, is to optimize happiness. But something lurks beneath the gloss. As TikTok has grown to more than 800 million users, it has begun to 
mirror the larger world: the quirks, passions, and prejudices of the people who have started to populate and influence the form. I'd heard stories like 
Blackmon's, bits and pieces of discouragement and grievance, but I wanted to understand it fully. So I started reaching out to TikTokers in all parts of the 
country, some veterans of the app, others new to it, to learn about their experiences, to see what was going on.
Over a period of two months, I heard from 29 Black creators who shared stories about muted posts, in-app harassment, and incidents of racism. They said the 
problems on the app are deeper and more widespread than simple isolated incidents. “Ever since I joined I've felt like the app is against me,” one told me. 
Another added, “It's disgusting how much they have allowed to go unchecked.” Together, their experiences belie the perception of TikTok as an app of joy and 
creativity, revealing instead a place tangled up in an ancient pain—a site of blurred visions and youthful ignorances, where flattery quickly turns into 
mockery, mockery into theft, and theft into something altogether more disturbing.
BEFORE SHE MADE it big on TikTok, Blackmon had built modest followings on other platforms. On YouTube, she posted videos about her life in a series she called 
STORYTIME. She talked about getting married at 19 (she's since divorced) and the time she tried (and failed, hilariously) to work as a stripper. Building an 
audience on Instagram proved harder. “You have to be on vacation,” Blackmon says, “or doing something extravagant,” which she wasn't. She didn't feel as if she 
could be herself.
Another app Blackmon checked out, but only as a spectator, was Vine. Launched in 2013, Vine was TikTok before TikTok. With a remarkably simple premise—upload 
six-second videos that would loop infinitely—Vine appealed to a dopamine-crazed culture that desired virality in short, repetitive bursts.
But the real allure of the app could be traced, in large part, to the ingenuity of the Black creators who made much of its most irresistible content. Bought by 
Twitter in 2012, Vine became the dominant engine of Black culture on the internet from around 2014 to 2016. It rivaled Twitter in its capacity to incubate 
trends, hyping Southern dance crazes such as the Nae Nae and career-boosting comedians like King Bach. “I was there for the short comedy,” Blackmon says. 
Arguably Vine's biggest impact was how it mainstreamed Black slang. In one of the most recognized Vines during that period, 16-year-old Kayla Newman—best known 
by her alias, Peaches Monroee—delights in her own fabulousness. “On fleek” was born, and The Culture adjusted accordingly.
The app eventually went bust. Its success led competitors, like Instagram, to create their own video features. And unlike YouTube, Vine never figured out a way 
to share revenue with users; a deal to pay top creators to produce content fell through in 2015. Big names departed the platform, and revenues dwindled. In 
2017, Twitter shut down Vine, and it was mourned largely by millennials and Gen Zers who'd made a home on the platform.
Around that time, ByteDance, a Beijing-based tech company at the forefront of Chinese social media, was launching an app called Douyin. In the early days, it 
was used to create homemade music videos, but users quickly turned it into a marketplace for all sorts of short-form content. By 2018, ByteDance had released 
the app outside China, acquired the lip-sync app Musical.ly, and renamed the international version TikTok. Vine supercharged—videos were now capped at 15 
seconds, and later 60—TikTok also offered a suite of editing tools, from filters to green-screen special effects, that gave creators near-limitless 
possibilities.
In the beginning, TikTok's embrace of wackiness and absence of anything even marginally serious was its prime attraction, and its most marketable one. Twitter 
was preoccupied with millennial bickering; the election of Donald Trump turned Facebook into a political echo chamber; Instagram felt plastic; gamers ran 
Twitch. On TikTok, kids just wanted to have fun. It was a place for dance challenges and wellness how-tos, movie reviews and the kind of existence-pondering 
comedy sketches BoJack Horseman might post were he on the app (or real). The platform elevated creativity and experimentation above all else; its algorithm, as 
Blackmon puts it, is generous. Though personalized based on user activity, For You feeds retain a light randomness—according to TikTok, the algorithm tries to 
avoid duplicating content or privileging accounts with large followings. As Blackmon says, “it's one of the only places where you can have no following, no 
content, and you post one thing and it gets a million views in a day.”
Blackmon signed up for TikTok in February, about a month before the Covid-19 stay-at-home orders started coming down. Like a diary, many of her early videos 
chronicle daily mundanities—cooking a buffalo chicken wrap, talking about natural hair, declaring a newfound love for iced coffee. “I don't know what Caucasian 
woman got into me, but iced coffee—bitch!” Blackmon says, raising the glass into the video frame. “Well call me Karen, OK,” she jokes, invoking the meme for 
privileged white womanhood. With more than half a million views, it was her first viral hit; she'd been on the app less than a month. A week later, she struck 
gold again. A video of Blackmon dancing with a stranger in the restroom mirror at a club racked up 615,000 views.
TikTok, it turned out, was reminiscent of Vine in more ways than one. The common denominator of many of its viral moments is an unspoken partiality to Black 
cultural expression. It works like an accelerant. Chart-topping rap songs, from the likes of Drake and K Camp and Megan Thee Stallion, provide the soundtrack 
to weekly dance challenges. Lil Nas X is the app's first breakout artist, and its most recognized pedagogue around self-improvement, Tabitha Brown, is a Black 
mother and vegan from North Carolina. When, at the end of 2019, a random voicemail of a Black woman colorfully referring to her coworker Rachel as a “big, fat, 
white, nasty-smelling, fat bitch” began to circulate, the woman's hostility and perceived sassiness became a costume for everyone to put on and make their own. 
The collective fascination again proved the point. As Blackmon puts it, “Be clear: Without Black culture, TikTok wouldn't even be a thing.”
Other creators, the majority of them white, have figured that out, too. In fact, they've come to learn that the quickest route to success on TikTok is right 
through the bountiful fields of Black expression.
IN A VIDEO uploaded to TikTok last December, a white teen saunters through an airport terminal, roller suitcase in hand. As he passes the check-in counter for 
Spirit—the notoriously awful low-cost airline—a look of mild irritation crosses his face. He glances left, then right. “Whew chile, the ghetto,” he says, 
elongating the o in ghetto. Only it's not the young man's voice we hear. It's that of reality diva NeNe Leakes, whose audio was pulled, edited, and 
resynchronized for the eight-second clip.
Chris Guarino, the guy with the suitcase, is an 18-year-old college student in South Florida. He joined TikTok “as a joke,” according to his bio, and his posts 
are generally preoccupied with goofball antics. Typical fare: In a video from last year, he mocks his dog Coco for having a “little potato booty.” On a good 
day, Guarino is lucky to get 1,000 eyes on a post. That is, until December, when he uploaded the Spirit airline parody. It became his biggest hit, exceeding 
half a million views.
Videos like Guarino's are among a disturbing and ongoing form of content production that suggests a twisted love of Black culture through caricature. It's been 
called digital blackface, and Blackmon started seeing examples of it almost immediately after she joined TikTok, mostly being posted by young white women and 
white gay men. “I have never seen so many teenagers who are this race-obsessed,” she says. “My Blackness is not a show, it's not something you just turn on.” 
Another user, 19-year-old Mia Brier, calls it “low-key racism”—you might have to sit with it for a moment before the extent of the ugliness becomes clear. 
(Guarino did not respond to messages seeking comment and before press time deleted his TikTok account.)
Minstrelsy thrives on TikTok, but the phenomenon goes back a long way. The earliest American iterations emerged in the 1840s as a form of entertainment and 
endured for more than a century. White people would darken their skin with burnt cork, greasepaint, or shoe polish and perform in variety shows. The musical 
acts, comedy sketches, and dances relied on stock characters, like Sambo and Zip Coon, to parade Blackness as laughably uneducated or as a target of 
humiliation. By the 1950s, the shows fell out of favor, but as Lauren Michele Jackson, the academic and author of White Negroes, put it, “the tenets of 
minstrel performance remain alive today in television, movies, music, and, in its most advanced iteration, on the internet.”
“My Blackness is not a show.”
BRIANNA BLACKMON
The very tools that have made TikTok into one of the most efficient, visible cultural products of the era—easy to use, hypercustomizable—make instances of 
digital blackface uniquely personal. Unlike Facebook and Twitter, where instances of digital blackface are either text-based (abusing Black vernacular) or 
image-based (trotting out memes or GIFs of Black celebrities), TikTok is a video-first platform, and on it, creators embody Blackness with an auteur-driven 
virtuosity—taking on Black rhythms, gestures, affect, slang. The most effective videos come down to one factor: how well a creator grabs hold of our attention. 
That is to say, how deftly they make what we watch theirs. Blackness is a proven attention getter. Its adoption is racism, custom-fit.
One highly visible avatar of the trend is the Hot Cheeto Girl, a meme that plays on the image of a loud and defiant low-income youth. The hashtag has over 160 
million views and is one of the app's more slippery instances of cultural distortion. For Whitney Roberts, a 35-year-old writer and podcast host in Philly, 
trends like the Hot Cheeto Girl have a troubling history that exemplify just one way already marginalized people are subtly debased on the app. “There were 
little white girls slicking their edges and drawing their eyebrows all weird,” Roberts says. “They would wrap tape around their fingers to be their fake nails. 
They'd put hoops on. When you call them out, it's, ‘Anyone of any race can be a Hot Cheeto Girl.’ No sweetheart, we know what you're doing. We know that the 
Hot Cheeto Girl is just a derivative of the ghetto girl, the hood rat, the Shanaynay that people used to call Black and Latinx women.” (TikTok has said it does 
not allow blackface, but how broadly it interprets blackface is an open question. Impersonations for the purposes of “parody” or “commentary” are permitted.)
The TikTok challenge is another fraught avenue for remixing racial stereotypes. Even if you follow TikTok only from a distance, you've likely heard about 
challenges. Usually started by a creator or influencer, a challenge spans all sorts of silliness. They include things like seeing which creator can best 
choreograph a dance (#Renegade) and who can swap clothes with their partner in the funniest way (#FlipTheSwitch). They spread from the original post outward, 
each creator attempting to put their own spin on it. The result has engendered a lively, sometimes strange culture of competition within the TikTok community.
Sometime on April 14, Carter Ricket uploaded the first iteration of what would become known as the #HowsMyForm challenge. In the opening frame, 17-year-old 
Ricket sets the bait with a raunchy caption: “Best S3X positions for guys with 9–12-inchers.” The challenge is meant to capitalize on a racial stereotype, 
which is soon made explicit. As rapper 645AR's song “Yoga” plays in the background, a new caption appears, insisting: “Ok, now that all the black guys are here 
can you help me with my waves!” The video garnered over 423,000 views and birthed one monstrous iteration after the next.
Almost every #HowsMyForm video played on degrading stereotypes of some kind—Middle Eastern people as terrorists, Mexicans as border-hopping illegal immigrants, 
poor white people as inbred hicks—and the majority of these videos use a three-act structure. The opening frame begins with a creator staring or lip-syncing 
into the camera as a “how to” statement pops on-screen (such as: “How to make the best fried chicken”); the next frame is followed by a greeting (such as: “Now 
that all the black people are here”); the stunt culminates in the third frame and typically ends on the very question—How's my form?—from which the challenge 
draws its name. Some of the most insidious satirize slavery. When viewers reach the final seconds of TikToker @Kalebcram's video, he freezes in place, bending 
forward as he pretends to pick cotton. “Hows my form,” the caption reads.
TikTok offers creators countless ways to customize their actions for the amusement and delight of scrollers. @Kalebcram chose to adorn his bent-over posture 
with a Photoshopped cotton plant and a meme of Martin Luther King Jr., just in case you didn't get the joke.
RACIAL MOCKERY IS not, I have to assume, the sole aim of these posts. What non-Black creators ultimately desire is what most TikTok creators desire—virality, clout, followers. To be seen and memed. One white TikToker I spoke with, Morgan Eckroth, a 21-year-old barista in Corvallis, Oregon, fears that many of her fellow creators don't understand the larger consequences of what they're doing. “Virality often occurs through shocking behavior,” says Eckroth, whose fame is mostly rooted in videos about making coffee in a small town. “Whether it's acting provocatively, bullying, or using racial slurs and stereotypes, a lot of users see that their questionable behavior gets a reaction, and that just encourages them.”
“You don’t need to get all worked up over this.” “You’re too angry for me to understand the point you’re making.” “Calm down.”
These phrases are all examples of tone policing, or responding to the presentation of an argument rather than the content of the argument itself. At its best, 
tone policing is an irritating behavior pattern that blocks meaningful conversation. But at its worst, tone policing is an insidious and sometimes 
hard-to-grasp method of reinforcing elitism and structural racism.
Tone policing is as rampant online as it is in person. As workplaces, schools, friends, and family groups continue to responsibly social distance, we’re 
spending more and more time communicating virtually. In these online arenas, tone policing can create space for pile-on responses, derailing a discussion when 
someone from the privileged side of the conversation focuses on the presentation of an argument rather than its content and all the following responses “pile 
on” to this language critique. …
orthwest of beijing’s Forbidden City, outside the Third Ring Road, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has spent seven decades building a campus of national 
laboratories. Near its center is the Institute of Automation, a sleek silvery-blue building surrounded by camera-studded poles. The institute is a basic 
research facility. Its computer scientists inquire into artificial intelligence’s fundamental mysteries. Their more practical innovations—iris recognition, 
cloud-based speech synthesis—are spun off to Chinese tech giants, AI start-ups, and, in some cases, the People’s Liberation Army.
Human identity, the idea that defines each and every one of us, could be facing an unprecedented crisis.
It is a crisis that would threaten long-held notions of who we are, what we do and how we behave.
It goes right to the heart - or the head - of us all. 
This crisis could reshape how we interact with each other, alter what makes us happy, and modify our capacity for reaching our full potential as individuals.
And it's caused by one simple fact: the human brain, that most sensitive of organs, is under threat from the modern world. 
Unless we wake up to the damage that the gadget-filled, pharmaceutically-enhanced 21st century is doing to our brains, we could be sleepwalking towards a 
future in which neuro-chip technology blurs the line between living and non-living machines, and between our bodies and the outside world.
It would be a world where such devices could enhance our muscle power, or our senses, beyond the norm, and where we all take a daily cocktail of drugs to 
control our moods and performance.
Already, an electronic chip is being developed that could allow a paralysed patient to move a robotic limb just by thinking about it.
 As for drug manipulated moods, they're already with us - although so far only to a medically prescribed extent.
Increasing numbers of people already take Prozac for depression, Paxil as an antidote for shyness, and give Ritalin to children to improve their concentration.
 But what if there were still more pills to enhance or "correct" a range of other specific mental functions?
What would such aspirations to be "perfect" or "better" do to our notions of identity, and what would it do to those who could not get their hands on the pills?
 Would some finally have become more equal than others, as George Orwell always feared?
Of course, there are benefits from technical progress - but there are great dangers as well, and I believe that we are seeing some of those today.
I'm a neuroscientist and my day-to-day research at Oxford University strives for an ever greater understanding - and therefore maybe, one day, a cure - for 
Alzheimer's disease.
But one vital fact I have learnt is that the brain is not the unchanging organ that we might imagine. 
It not only goes on developing, changing and, in some tragic cases, eventually deteriorating with age, it is also substantially shaped by what we do to it and 
by the experience of daily life. 
When I say "shaped", I'm not talking figuratively or metaphorically; I'm talking literally. 
At a microcellular level, the infinitely complex network of nerve cells that make up the constituent parts of the brain actually change in response to certain 
experiences and stimuli.
The brain, in other words, is malleable - not just in early childhood but right up to early adulthood, and, in certain instances, beyond. 
The surrounding environment has a huge impact both on the way our brains develop and how that brain is transformed into a unique human mind.
Of course, there's nothing new about that: human brains have been changing, adapting and developing in response to outside stimuli for centuries.
What prompted me to write my book is that the pace of change in the outside environment and in the development of new technologies has increased dramatically.
 This will affect our brains over the next 100 years in ways we might never have imagined.
Our brains are under the influence of an ever- expanding world of new technology: multichannel television, video games, MP3 players, the internet, wireless 
networks, Bluetooth links - the list goes on and on.
But our modern brains are also having to adapt to other 21st century intrusions, some of which, such as prescribed drugs like Ritalin and Prozac, are supposed 
to be of benefit, and some of which, such as widelyavailable illegal drugs like cannabis and heroin, are not.
Electronic devices and pharmaceutical drugs all have an impact on the micro- cellular structure and complex biochemistry of our brains.
 And that, in turn, affects our personality, our behaviour and our characteristics. In short, the modern world could well be altering our human identity.
Three hundred years ago, our notions of human identity were vastly simpler: we were defined by the family we were born into and our position within that family. 
Social advancement was nigh on impossible and the concept of "individuality" took a back seat.
That only arrived with the Industrial Revolution, which for the first time offered rewards for initiative, ingenuity and ambition. 
Suddenly, people had their own life stories - ones which could be shaped by their own thoughts and actions. 
For the first time, individuals had a real sense of self.
But with our brains now under such widespread attack from the modern world, there's a danger that that cherished sense of self could be diminished or even lost.
Anyone who doubts the malleability of the adult brain should consider a startling piece of research conducted at Harvard Medical School.
 There, a group of adult volunteers, none of whom could previously play the piano, were split into three groups.
The first group were taken into a room with a piano and given intensive piano practise for five days. The second group were taken into an identical room with 
an identical piano - but had nothing to do with the instrument at all.
And the third group were taken into an identical room with an identical piano and were then told that for the next five days they had to just imagine they were 
practising piano exercises.
The resultant brain scans were extraordinary. Not surprisingly, the brains of those who simply sat in the same room as the piano hadn't changed at all.
Equally unsurprising was the fact that those who had performed the piano exercises saw marked structural changes in the area of the brain associated with 
finger movement.
But what was truly astonishing was that the group who had merely imagined doing the piano exercises saw changes in brain structure that were almost as 
pronounced as those that had actually had lessons. "The power of imagination" is not a metaphor, it seems; it's real, and has a physical basis in your brain.
Alas, no neuroscientist can explain how the sort of changes that the Harvard experimenters reported at the micro-cellular level translate into changes in 
character, personality or behaviour. But we don't need to know that to realise that changes in brain structure and our higher thoughts and feelings are 
incontrovertibly linked.
What worries me is that if something as innocuous as imagining a piano lesson can bring about a visible physical change in brain structure, and therefore some 
presumably minor change in the way the aspiring player performs, what changes might long stints playing violent computer games bring about? That eternal 
teenage protest of 'it's only a game, Mum' certainly begins to ring alarmingly hollow.
Already, it's pretty clear that the screen-based, two dimensional world that so many teenagers - and a growing number of adults - choose to inhabit is 
producing changes in behaviour. Attention spans are shorter, personal communication skills are reduced and there's a marked reduction in the ability to think 
abstractly.
This games-driven generation interpret the world through screen-shaped eyes. It's almost as if something hasn't really happened until it's been posted on 
Facebook, Bebo or YouTube.
Add that to the huge amount of personal information now stored on the internet - births, marriages, telephone numbers, credit ratings, holiday pictures - and 
it's sometimes difficult to know where the boundaries of our individuality actually lie. Only one thing is certain: those boundaries are weakening.
And they could weaken further still if, and when, neurochip technology becomes more widely available. These tiny devices will take advantage of the discovery 
that nerve cells and silicon chips can happily co-exist, allowing an interface between the electronic world and the human body. One of my colleagues recently 
suggested that someone could be fitted with a cochlear implant (devices that convert sound waves into electronic impulses and enable the deaf to hear) and a 
skull-mounted micro- chip that converts brain waves into words (a prototype is under research).
Then, if both devices were connected to a wireless network, we really would have arrived at the point which science fiction writers have been getting excited 
about for years. Mind reading!
He was joking, but for how long the gag remains funny is far from clear.
Today's technology is already producing a marked shift in the way we think and behave, particularly among the young.
I mustn't, however, be too censorious, because what I'm talking about is pleasure. For some, pleasure means wine, women and song; for others, more recently, 
sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll; and for millions today, endless hours at the computer console.
But whatever your particular variety of pleasure (and energetic sport needs to be added to the list), it's long been accepted that 'pure' pleasure - that is to 
say, activity during which you truly "let yourself go" - was part of the diverse portfolio of normal human life. Until now, that is.
Now, coinciding with the moment when technology and pharmaceutical companies are finding ever more ways to have a direct influence on the human brain, pleasure 
is becoming the sole be-all and end-all of many lives, especially among the young.
We could be raising a hedonistic generation who live only in the thrill of the computer-generated moment, and are in distinct danger of detaching themselves 
from what the rest of us would consider the real world.
This is a trend that worries me profoundly. For as any alcoholic or drug addict will tell you, nobody can be trapped in the moment of pleasure forever. Sooner 
or later, you have to come down.
I'm certainly not saying all video games are addictive (as yet, there is not enough research to back that up), and I genuinely welcome the new generation of 
"brain-training" computer games aimed at keeping the little grey cells active for longer.
As my Alzheimer's research has shown me, when it comes to higher brain function, it's clear that there is some truth in the adage "use it or lose it".
However, playing certain games can mimic addiction, and that the heaviest users of these games might soon begin to do a pretty good impersonation of an addict.
Throw in circumstantial evidence that links a sharp rise in diagnoses of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and the associated three-fold increase in 
Ritalin prescriptions over the past ten years with the boom in computer games and you have an immensely worrying scenario.
But we mustn't be too pessimistic about the future. It may sound frighteningly Orwellian, but there may be some potential advantages to be gained from our 
growing understanding of the human brain's tremendous plasticity. What if we could create an environment that would allow the brain to develop in a way that 
was seen to be of universal benefit?
I'm not convinced that scientists will ever find a way of manipulating the brain to make us all much cleverer (it would probably be cheaper and far more 
effective to manipulate the education system). And nor do I believe that we can somehow be made much happier - not, at least, without somehow anaesthetising 
ourselves against the sadness and misery that is part and parcel of the human condition.
When someone I love dies, I still want to be able to cry.
But I do, paradoxically, see potential in one particular direction. I think it possible that we might one day be able to harness outside stimuli in such a way 
that creativity - surely the ultimate expression of individuality - is actually boosted rather than diminished.
I am optimistic and excited by what future research will reveal into the workings of the human brain, and the extraordinary process by which it is translated 
into a uniquely individual mind.
But I'm also concerned that we seem to be so oblivious to the dangers that are already upon us.
Well, that debate must start now. Identity, the very essence of what it is to be human, is open to change - both good and bad. Our children, and certainly our 
grandchildren, will not thank us if we put off discussion much longer.
OnOctober 9, 2019 — Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year — a young white man attempted to enter a synagogue in Halle, Germany, with what appeared to 
be at least six homemade firearms while livestreaming via the gaming platform Twitch. Unable to enter the building, which had about 80 people inside, the man 
began shooting on the street, killing two and injuring two others. The gunman was a 27-year-old right-wing extremist with anti-Semitic and far-right views who 
had outlined his beliefs in a “manifesto” he uploaded online shortly before attempting to enter the synagogue. During the confusion following the attack, news 
outlets reported he had committed the atrocity using a 3D-printed gun.
The idea of a mass shooter using 3D printing technology shocked and intrigued those following the developing story from afar. U.K. newspaper The Independent 
cautioned, “Use of 3D printed guns in German synagogue shooting must act as a warning to security services, experts say,” while the Wall Street Journal 
screamed, “Is 3-D Printing the Future of Terrorism?”
The threat of the 3D-printed gun has loomed large in the American imagination for nearly a decade. In 2013, Cody Wilson, the founder of Defense Distributed — 
an open-source collective devoted to developing printable guns — unveiled plans for the world’s first entirely 3D-printed gun: The “Liberator,” a 
clunky-looking, single-shot, plastic beige handgun named in honor of the FP-45 Liberator, a pistol that U.S. soldiers dropped behind enemy lines to resistance 
fighters in Nazi-occupied territories during World War II. Shortly after Wilson released the files online, the State Department forced him to take them down, 
jump-starting a debate over guns, gun control, and free speech that continues to pop up whenever 3D-printed firearms are mentioned. Wilson wasn’t penalized for 
making his Liberator prototype, though; the feds only swooped in once he shared the blueprints online.
It turned out that news reports had overstated the Halle gunman’s weapons; he hadn’t used a 3D-printed gun like the fully plastic, single-shot Liberator. 
Researchers at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College London confirmed that the two firearms used had only been partially 
constructed with the 3D-printed parts of a trigger clip and torch barrel attachment on a Luty submachine gun and a shell holder attachment on a shotgun.
According to his writing online, the Halle gunman had held a longtime interest in homemade weapons and had written in his manifesto that he’d wanted to take 
this opportunity to demonstrate their viability. Fortunately, both of the weapons he used malfunctioned at least three times, leading the gunman to yelp in 
frustration on his livestream, “I have certainly managed to prove how absurd improvised weapons are!”
3D-printed guns fall into the larger category of homemade firearms, known colloquially as “ghost guns” — an established, if slightly niche, part of gun 
culture, especially in America. The U.S. is home to a long tradition of DIY gunsmithing that stretches back to the Colonial era, when local blacksmiths forged 
musket barrels as well as horseshoes. Eli Whitney, the inventor of the cotton gin, also pioneered the “interchangeable parts” method of production, which was 
used by legions of individual craftsmen to manufacture thousands of muskets during the 1790s.
Thanks to the Second Amendment, there are few paths to regulate or legislate ghost guns out of existence, and cracking down on 3D printing will only do so much.
Ghost guns have risen in popularity thanks in part to the 2004 expiration of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which had prohibited U.S. residents from 
owning different kinds of assault weapons as well as various types of large-capacity magazines. Most modern firearms hobbyists have since taken to using parts 
kits, which are easily attainable through internet retailers. There are a number of varieties on offer, from Glock handguns to classic 1911 pistols to more 
advanced weaponry. The one thing all of these homemade firearms have in common — from the rudimentary to the cutting edge — is that they are untraceable, 
untrackable, and, provided one follows a few cursory rules, completely legal under U.S. federal law.
For those wishing to make their own AR-15 rifles, the most important DIY component is its lower receiver, which connects the stock, barrel, magazine, and other 
parts. After the assault weapons ban expired, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said that it would no longer characterize an AR-15 
receiver as a firearm as long as the trigger cavity was not yet milled out. This small distinction made it legal for online retailers to sell as many 
80%-completed AR-15 receivers — as well as other varieties and accessories — as they liked. With the right tools, some basic know-how, and a little bit of 
old-fashioned elbow grease, anyone can make their own unregistered AR-15 rifle sans background check, sans waiting period, and sans government oversight.
Ghost guns periodically end up in the news and tend to trigger a chain reaction of intrigue and horror when they do. The primary sticking point for people 
seems to be their untraceable, unregistered aspect; law enforcement issues dire warnings about “criminals” using them for nefarious means, and the gun-control 
advocates who push for more firearms regulation are understandably alarmed by their existence. Add 3D-printing to that equation — a technology that essentially 
allows a person to create an object out of thin air — and you’ve got a recipe for public concern.
In March of this year, Defense Distributed relaunched DEFCAD, a massive online library of downloadable design files that, for an annual fee, are available to 
all U.S. residents. President Donald Trump expressed momentary interest in 3D gun blueprints in 2018, and his administration has attempted to transfer 
regulation of these guns away from the State Department, which would allow for broader distribution. A number of state attorneys asked the Trump administration 
to crack down on the site immediately after it went live, but as of now, DEFCAD remains victorious — and currently boasts over 23,000 registered users.
Yet for all the hubbub around Wilson’s Liberator, it is still a clunky, goofy-looking, single-shot gun — more of a political statement than a functional 
weapon. While the impact Wilson and Defense Distributed have had on the field is insurmountable, they’re no longer the only game in town. For better or worse, 
thousands of people are now getting in on the ghost gun action using 3D printing — fashioning parts instead of an entire plastic gun. Even before the 
coronavirus pandemic sent sales of parts kits skyrocketing, these untraceable weapons were exploding in popularity. In 2019, D.C. police seized 116 ghost guns; 
in 2018, the number was 25; in 2017, they seized three.
Thanks to the Second Amendment, there are few paths to regulate or legislate ghost guns out of existence, and cracking down on 3D printing will only do so 
much, especially at a time when the technology is enjoying an upswing in popularity due to its efficacy in churning out personal protective equipment. 
3D-printed guns aren’t the stuff of science-fiction nightmares — they’re already here.
InOctober 2017, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke at a VIP-laden press event in Toronto to announce plans for a new neighborhood in the city to be 
built “from the internet up.” The big reveal was the builder: Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet, the parent company of Google. The mood was festive, 
optimistic. Schoolchildren were on hand with Lego models of future cityscapes, which Trudeau, flanked by Eric Schmidt, Alphabet’s then–executive chairman, and 
John Tory, the Toronto mayor, explored in a flawlessly staged photo op.
The prime minister spoke in earnest tones. Quayside, as the 12-acre waterfront project had been christened, would be “a testbed for new technologies,” he said, 
“that will help us build smarter, greener, more inclusive cities.” Not one to shy away from wholesome platitudes, he added, “The future, just like this 
community, will be interconnected.”
Then Schmidt rose to the lectern and said that Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin had long opined about “all of these things that we could do if 
someone would just give us a city and put us in charge.” Chuckles reverberated through the crowd.
News that Alphabet had leaped neck deep into the smart city business lit up tech media for weeks. Sidewalk Labs’ renderings for the project — autonomous carts 
delivering packages and hauling away waste maneuvered in underground tunnels, while barefoot kids, butterflies, and birds cavorted in a 
Jetsons-meets-organic-living neighborhood at street level — flashed across the internet. Local news stations covered the project dotingly, picking up the 
Sidewalk Labs talking point that a network of sensors and other IT infrastructure embedded in the community would enable a new era of urban efficiency. Homes 
and workplaces in Quayside would “study occupants’ behavior while they’re inside them to make life easier,” said a reporter on one evening broadcast after the 
press event. Quayside would be “the first neighborhood of its kind,” he said, and — as if one superlative wasn’t enough — it would be “a community like none 
other.”
Sidewalk Labs’ rosy vision for Quayside, however, will not come to be. In May, the company announced it was abandoning the project, citing economic 
infeasibility. But what wasn’t mentioned was that the project had also become politically infeasible. The Quayside announcement inspired a groundswell of 
resistance, first among civil liberties activists, and then, eventually, among the ranks of Canada’s most prominent businesspeople, local civic leaders, and 
Toronto residents. Objections ranged from fears of Orwellian surveillance to Canadians’ general skepticism of the American culture of exceptionalism, so 
perfectly embodied by a Silicon Valley–designed smart city.
The Quayside vision was born at the peak of the tech giants’ cultural prowess. Today, the era of techno-optimism seems all but dead. The demise of the most 
ambitious smart city project in North America, backed by one of the most powerful corporations on the planet, came at the hands of a small group of Toronto 
activists — and one disaffected tech billionaire. The story of their battle is a parable, not just for the smart city movement, but also for a growing sense 
that the tech industry, with its promise of data-driven solutions to structural and institutional problems, won’t save us.
Sidewalk Labs was founded in 2015 by Dan Doctoroff, a former Wall Street analyst and private equity managing partner who served as a deputy mayor of New York 
under Michael Bloomberg. Billed as an “urban innovation” startup and armed with the deep pockets of its parent company, Sidewalk Labs has incubated two urban 
planning tools and spun off a few subsidiaries of its own. Those include Coord, which sells curb management software to municipal governments, and Cityblock, 
which establishes health care clinics in low-income neighborhoods. Prior to Quayside, Sidewalk Labs’ most public-facing project was LinkNYC, a series of 
curbside kiosks across New York City’s five boroughs that provide free Wi-Fi and broadcast ads on their 55-inch screens — all while collecting a variety of 
data with the three cameras and 30 sensors housed in each kiosk.
But Quayside was to be the company’s magnum opus: transforming what had previously been an area east of downtown Toronto characterized by desolate parking lots 
and the graffiti-strewn foundations of demolished buildings into a living laboratory for an urban future in which technology would be embedded in every nook 
and cranny.
On one level, the vision was gadgety: Park benches might count how many people came to sit on them each hour, and curbside trash cans could alert the 
sanitation department when they were full. But the plans laid out in Sidewalk Labs’ initial proposal were far more comprehensive, encompassing an integrated 
digital layer for the full gamut of civic services, including urban planning, mass transit, road infrastructure, utility systems, social services, even health 
care. In a blog post, a Toronto tech entrepreneur who had interviewed for a job with the company said he was asked for his ideas about integrating technology 
with voting systems. Ultimately, the company hoped to develop a sort of urban operating system that could then be exported to other cities. Trudeau said he 
envisioned the technology spreading beyond Quayside across Toronto’s eastern waterfront and, ultimately, to “other parts of Canada and around the world.”
In October 2017, Sidewalk Labs signed an initial agreement with Waterfront Toronto, an agency with a 25-year mandate to redevelop 2,000 acres of the city’s 
downtown lakefront. Charged with overseeing some of the most strategic real estate in Canada, it is almost a government of its own, with the municipal, 
provincial, and federal governments each appointing four board members and asserting equal control over its affairs. The contract stipulated a period of 
planning and public engagement (originally set for one year, but later extended amid mounting resistance), during which input on the project would be sought.
I attended one of these meetings. Swarms of Sidewalk Labs employees — young, energetic, and dressed in blue T-shirts — milled around answering questions and 
hyping the project. A similar vibe filled a defunct fish processing plant adjacent to the Quayside site where the company set up an office with an attached 
visitor center of sorts. Painted the same blue as the Sidewalk Labs T-shirts, the visitor center showcased some of the flashier technologies proposed for 
Quayside, such as “building raincoats” that could spring out from a facade to make outdoor space more usable in inclement weather, and street pavers with 
embedded lights that would heat the pavement and could act as changeable lane markings. In conjunction with autonomous vehicle technology, these could allow 
lanes to shift according to real-time traffic flow. There were also boards where visitors could leave messages. Suspicion of the project emerged early. When I 
visited, the boards were heavy on criticism. “Is Google Big Brother now?” asked one commenter.
The backlash to Sidewalk Labs’ Quayside project began almost as soon as Trudeau left the stage of the announcement event. Two weeks later, at the first 
community meeting for the project, anti-gentrification protesters gathered outside, while inside, a Q&A session with Doctoroff was at times confrontational. 
After he used the word “platform” to describe Sidewalk Labs’ venture in Toronto, one audience member rose to the microphone to express his concern.
“So, I’m just really curious,” he said, as to whether Doctoroff had any thoughts about “the power and wealth concentration that happens with platform 
ventures?” The crowd applauded.
“That is a fabulous question,” Doctoroff replied. “It’s a hard question to answer,” he continued, “but I will tell you that amongst ourselves we’ve talked 
about sort of different models of governance and ownership.” The intention, Doctoroff said, was for the Sidewalk Labs platform to be “open” to IT developers to 
“build things on top of it” — Google’s Android operating system is open in this way — “where, at the end of the day, they’ll be the beneficiaries of their 
intellectual capital and hard work, and not the platform itself.”
But with all the talk of sensors and data collection, it was privacy advocates who formed the largest and loudest contingent of skeptics.
Sidewalk Labs, no doubt anticipating this criticism, had retained the former information and privacy commissioner of Ontario, Ann Cavoukian, PhD, as a 
consultant-slash-surrogate. The month after the announcement, Cavoukian appeared on The Agenda, a popular Canadian talk show, along with Bianca Wylie, a 
Toronto activist and self-described “open government advocate” who was quickly emerging as the leading critic of the project. “The ability to track citizens, 
to engage in surveillance with the technology that they’re proposing — that’s not going to happen,” Cavoukian told listeners. “I can provide that assurance.”
But Wylie was dubious of the assurances of a paid consultant, and particularly concerned with the collection of “aggregate data… how the city is working, where 
people are using things, what the transportation flow is like.” She continued, “If a company is taking that data and using it to build products and services to 
then sell back to us, why isn’t that intellectual property and the value of that data ours as residents of the city?” She pointed out that tech companies’ 
plans for data collection in public space far outpaced citizens’ ability to comprehend the implications, much less governments’ ability to regulate the 
fast-growing smart city industry.
Wylie’s biggest fear about Quayside, however, was that Sidewalk Labs’ profiteering would come at the expense of democracy. Sidewalk Labs’ proposal encompassed 
many of the functions of municipal government, but without the accountability we expect from elected officials. Just as Google monopolizes search, critics 
feared a similar scenario in the smart city market. They argued that data collected in public space, where opting out isn’t an option, would herald a new age 
of surveillance. And the agreement between Toronto and Sidewalk Labs was proceeding without a single vote from a local resident.
“It is not innovative to be partnering with, basically, a monopoly,” Wylie told listeners. Cavoukian furrowed her brow. The show’s other guest, a former 
architecture critic at the Toronto Star and a Sidewalk Labs supporter, looked perplexed. Besides, said Wylie, the most intractable urban problems won’t be 
solved by Silicon Valley giants throwing technology at them. “Is A.I. and technology going to help us have a more equitable city?” she asked, cautioning 
against “tech solutionism.”
The first wave of pushback against Sidewalk Labs had a grassroots, down-with-capitalism vibe — edgy, left-leaning urban affairs publications like Spacing 
churned out one skeptical story after another. Torontoist hosted a crowdsourced list of questions for Sidewalk Labs, which were mostly unanswered. But soon 
other voices, including from the C-suite, chimed in.
On a snowy night in 2018, I sat in a leather armchair aboard a private jet en route from Washington, D.C., to Waterloo, Ontario. Across from me was billionaire 
philanthropist Jim Balsillie, the former co-CEO and co-chairman of Research in Motion, the Waterloo company that created BlackBerry phones. Tall and athletic, 
Balsillie has a reputation in Canadian business circles as a reserved but forceful character known to berate those who he disagrees with. For nearly two 
decades, Google had been a thorn in Balsillie’s side. Though it was the iPhone that first dethroned the BlackBerry from the top of the smartphone market, 
Android — used in a huge number of phones across price points — cemented BlackBerry’s descent into tech’s history bin. After several years of trying to keep 
the BlackBerry afloat, Balsillie retired from the board in 2012 and devoted himself to making the Canadian tech industry more competitive with Silicon Valley.
Everything about the Quayside project made Balsillie furious. First off, despite the fact that at least one Canadian consortium was shortlisted to compete with 
Sidewalk Labs for the bid, a U.S. company had ultimately been selected. Balsillie also held special ire for Waterfront Toronto and its then CEO, Will Fleissig, 
an American architect and real estate developer.
Balsillie described Waterfront Toronto leadership to me, variously, as “naive,” “insecure,” and “treasonous.” As the nation’s leading tech figure, he was 
brought on by the agency in 2018 as an informal adviser for the Quayside project, despite his hostility. I asked how that was going. “It’s going good,” he 
said, with a wry grin. “There’s a little run on Alka-Seltzer at the local pharmacy every time we have our chitty-chat.”
Just as the Sidewalk Labs project was taking shape, Balsillie was undergoing something of an ideological transformation. A longtime defender of the Canadian 
tech industry, he was evolving from a tech evangelist to tech reformist. Balsillie is a friend and collaborator of billionaire investor George Soros, and the 
two share a similar outlook of the tech industry. In a January 2018 speech in Davos, Soros characterized companies like Google and Facebook as a “menace” to 
democracy. “There could be an alliance between authoritarian states and these large data-rich IT monopolies that would bring together nascent systems of 
corporate surveillance with an already developing system of state-sponsored surveillance,” Soros said. “This may well result in a web of totalitarian control 
the likes of which not even Aldous Huxley or George Orwell could have imagined.”
In early 2018, Balsillie also began to speak out aggressively against the tech industry. Testifying in Ottawa at a hearing about the Cambridge Analytica 
scandal in May that year, he told members of a parliamentary committee that “Facebook and Google are companies built exclusively on the principle of mass 
surveillance.” The danger of partnering with foreign companies like Sidewalk Labs was that “our data is subject to foreign laws, making Canada a client state,” 
he’d said.
“The ability to track citizens, to engage in surveillance with the technology that they’re proposing — that’s not going to happen”
Balsillie was also taking his grievances to the world stage. The night I joined him on his jet, he was flying home after giving a speech at the International 
Monetary Fund headquarters, just a few blocks from the White House. He’d told the roomful of economists that the prosperity of the 20th century, based 
primarily on the trade of tangible goods, had “created rising tides that lifted all boats.” But the rise of the intangibles economy, as he put it, driven by 
the battle to monopolize data, “lifts mostly a few yachts.” He spoke from experience.
Over the course of the project’s first year, the media narrative shifted from doting to questioning. One of the most inflammatory headlines came from an 
October 2018 op-ed Balsillie wrote in the Globe and Mail. Quayside “is not a smart city,” but a “pseudo-tech dystopia,” he wrote. “It is a colonizing 
experiment in surveillance capitalism attempting to bulldoze important urban, civic and political issues.” In another op-ed earlier that year, he blamed the 
situation on lawmakers’ “colonial supplicant attitude” toward the United States. Canada, he wrote, was at risk of “becoming not just a cheap tech branch plant 
economy… but also a client-state, politically and militarily subordinate.”
The project polarized Canadians between those who wanted elected officials to show Sidewalk Labs the door and those who thought the first camp was paranoid and 
unreasonable. Waterfront Toronto fell under immense pressure and promised more public meetings for residents to voice their concerns. In November 2018, just 
over a year after the project was first announced, Sidewalk Labs staff gave a slideshow to Alphabet about the headwinds they faced in Toronto. “The majority of 
the negative press coverage is rooted in an anti-global tech giant narrative being spun by… Jim Balsillie,” said the presentation, which was later leaked to 
the press.
While Sidewalk Labs mounted a massive PR campaign to garner public support — alongside an extensive though more discreet lobbying campaign in the halls of 
power — Balsillie leveraged his contacts within the Canadian political and business establishment to build opposition. By the winter of 2018, Toronto city 
council members began voicing concerns. A report from the National Research Council from December 2017, which journalists uncovered in June 2018, said that 
Canada was in danger of becoming a “data cow” for foreign tech platforms (though Sidewalk Labs was not explicitly mentioned). And Trudeau came under fire for 
appearing, in critics’ eyes, as more sympathetic to Silicon Valley interests than to Canadians’ — to the point of corruption, some believed.
A report from the National Research Council… said that Canada was in danger of becoming a “data cow” for foreign tech platforms
Many of those allegations were rooted in the original bidding process for the Quayside project. Though the Quayside project was open to bids from any qualified 
party, Trudeau’s language during the October press event suggested that the winner had been predetermined. “Eric and I have been talking about collaborating on 
this for a few years now, and seeing it all come together is extraordinarily exciting,” said Trudeau, speaking of Eric Schmidt, the Alphabet chairman. A 
spokeswoman for the prime minister told me that the comment referred to a general intent to collaborate and was not in reference to the Sidewalk Labs project 
in particular, but doubts lingered.
Further raising eyebrows, the press conference took place one day after the Waterfront Toronto board voted to approve their initial agreement with Sidewalk 
Labs, a complex legal document the board was given just the weekend to review. But the press conference looked meticulously arranged: In addition to the kids 
and their Legos, a slick promo video featuring staff of both Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalk Labs was screened. Did they pull that together the afternoon 
before? Did the VIPs from Ottawa and Silicon Valley drop everything to fly in on less than a day’s notice? Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalk Labs officials have 
insisted there were no improprieties in the selection process and assured me that the event would have been called off had the board not voted yes.
But Julie Di Lorenzo, a Waterfront Toronto board member who resigned in June 2018 in protest over elements of the Sidewalk Labs project, said the deal was 
“jammed inappropriately on the board with no time to review.”
In October 2018, Charlie Angus, a member of Canadian Parliament who was on the committee investigating Cambridge Analytica, sent a letter to Trudeau’s 
infrastructure minister, urging the government to “hit the pause button” on the Quayside project. “Data-opolies like Google have done little to reassure the 
public that they can be trusted without strong regulatory oversight,” he wrote. Moving forward without a more robust policy framework in place would risk 
“creating a 21st century company town,” he added — “a privatized surveillance city.” Angus, a member of the New Democratic Party, which leans left of Trudeau’s 
Liberal Party, also issued a statement a month later accusing the administration of being in bed with Alphabet, citing two government officials who had 
recently taken jobs with Sidewalk Labs. “This unhealthy culture of coziness between the Liberal government and Sidewalk/Google is not in the public interest,” 
wrote Angus, a former bass player who was once described in a National Post article as a “socialist punk rocker with a big heart.”
Then, in December 2018, the Ontario Auditor General published the results of a damning investigation into Waterfront Toronto’s handling of Quayside. Unearthed 
emails showed that the agency was already discussing a project with Sidewalk Labs in 2016 and that board members had been “urged — strongly” to approve the 
deal. One email even speculated about the fallout that might occur from Sidewalk Labs’ intent to “control ALL data.”
“It’s obvious the fix was in for Google,” Angus told me when I spoke to him at the time.
Three Waterfront Toronto board members were fired in the aftermath of the investigation. In addition to Di Lorenzo, several members of a panel of experts 
convened to advise the agency on the project had departed, along with Will Fleissig, the agency’s CEO, who left in mid-2018.
Even Ann Cavoukian, the Sidewalk Labs consultant who sparred with Wylie on The Agenda, switched camps. Upon tendering her resignation, she said, “I wanted this 
to become a smart city of privacy — not a smart city of surveillance.”
While the pro-Sidewalk and anti-Sidewalk camps fought a war of words in the press, most residents remained in favor of the project through early 2019. I lived 
in Toronto throughout this period, and many of my acquaintances found the talk about a surveillance state at Quayside a tad conspiracy theoryish. A poll in 
early February 2019 revealed that 55% of 600 Toronto residents supported the project, while only 11% were opposed. For critics of the project, this reflected a 
public ill-equipped to understand what a 12-acre futuristic neighborhood had to do with the future of democracy. A group of Toronto activists set out to 
educate them.
On a cold, windy night around this time, I arrived at the Toronto Media Arts Centre, in the city’s trendy West Queen West neighborhood, for a workshop billed 
as a “design jam” on the theme of “What is data?” meant to enlighten citizens to how data can be used and misused. I overheard conversations about the 
mountains of genetic data being amassed by ancestry websites and how Facebook maintains “shadow profiles.” Facilitators offered tricks for keeping the data 
overlords at bay. Pizza and art materials were provided.
The workshop was put on by the Digital Justice Lab, a group formed during Toronto’s Quayside crucible whose initiatives included a project to teach data 
literacy and a series of BIPOC-only events. Digital Justice Lab had an early partnership with an organization founded by Balsillie. “The idea is to build 
community capacity around digital rights,” said Digital Justice Lab’s founder Nasma Ahmed, the young woman at the workshop who sat behind a sticker-plastered 
laptop wearing a black head wrap, horn-rimmed glasses, and a nose ring. “People don’t even have the language to have a public conversation around data 
practices, privacy, smart cities.”
Scandalous headlines about the Quayside project kept coming. On Valentine’s Day 2019, news broke that the company’s plans for Toronto were more extensive than 
had been disclosed. The company had previously floated the idea that the Quayside project could be expanded to the Port Lands, an adjacent 800-plus acres of 
derelict industrial land that is among the largest, most desirable undeveloped tracts of urban real estate in North America. The idea had been met with stiff 
resistance across the city — the Port Lands are nearly the equivalent of the city’s downtown core — and Sidewalk Labs had been forced to retreat from the idea. 
But documents obtained by the Toronto Star suggested that Sidewalk Labs was still negotiating for 350 of those acres, news that galvanized a large segment of 
residents.
About two weeks later, Ahmed joined Wylie and about 30 other community leaders, activists, and academics to launch the #BlockSidewalk campaign, the first 
coordinated effort to terminate the project. Ana Serrano, the president and vice chancellor of the Ontario College of Art and Design University and one of the 
group’s original members, described #BlockSidewalk as “a citizen-run volunteer organization that came together organically after the news of the land grab.” 
She told me recently, “It became clear for many in Toronto at that time, regardless of their background, that there needed to be some form of democratic 
process around how we build out that land.”
In June 2019, after several delays, Sidewalk Labs presented its much-anticipated master plan for Quayside. The 1,500-page plan — worth at least $2.9 billion in 
real estate and development projects — walked back the Port Lands expansion from 350 to 190 acres. In addition to building raincoats and tunnels for autonomous 
trash collection carts, a green energy system was proposed. The buildings would be constructed largely with mass timber — a compression of multiple wood pieces 
that can sequester carbon, considered a cutting-edge technology for structures more than a few stories tall — and Sidewalk Labs would fund a special factory to 
provide it. Great pains were taken to address concerns about data governance: Sidewalk Labs proposed that an independent “data trust” be established, a 
watchdog of sorts, to oversee the collection and management of all data collected, and the company again swore never to sell personal data, use it for ads, or 
monetize it in any way.
The plan was an olive branch to naysayers but did little to quell the rising tide of criticism. That spring, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association helped 
file a lawsuit against Waterfront Toronto, which alleged that the data collection proposed by Sidewalk Labs would infringe on constitutional rights. 
“Non-consensual surrender by the state to Sidewalk Labs and/or others of private data” could inhibit free speech and public assembly, the lawsuit said. “This 
curtails or negates critical freedoms in a democracy where collective behavior plays an important political and social role.”
The same day the master plan was released, the new board chair of Waterfront Toronto, Stephen Diamond, who had been appointed with a mandate to put the company 
on a shorter leash, issued an open letter stating that the master plan had to be dialed back even further. If Sidewalk Labs was unwilling to do so, the 
negotiations would be terminated. “The city of Toronto could get by without Sidewalk Labs, to be quite frank,” Diamond said that fall.
The activism — both at the grassroots level and top-down messaging from Balsillie — was working. A month after the master plan came out, a new poll showed that 
four times as many residents were now opposed to the project than just a few months earlier. Six out of 10 respondents said they did not trust Sidewalk Labs to 
collect data, with a similar number expressing doubt that the company would honor its pledge to not use data for advertising.
On Halloween 2019, Waterfront Toronto agreed to the new terms presented by Sidewalk Labs for the project. The scope would be reset to the original 12 acres. 
Data would be stored in Canada and subject to domestic law. Infrastructure development would be controlled by the agency rather than the company. And the 
government would “be entitled to a revenue stream on products and services piloted in Waterfront Toronto-facilitated testbeds, based on global net revenues.” 
Sidewalk Labs was given several months to revise its plan according to the new terms — Quayside was alive, but on life support.
As2020 dawned, it seemed unclear whether Sidewalk Labs leadership was indeed willing to squish their lofty ambitions into those increasingly constricted 12 
acres. Sidewalk Labs and Waterfront Toronto both declined interview requests, but Helen Burstyn, the former Waterfront Toronto board chair who was one of the 
three board members fired by the province after the 2018 investigation, offered an inside perspective on negotiations between the two parties. While the agency 
attempted to maintain an appearance of unity with the company early on, Burstyn said that behind the scenes, the relationship was fraught from day one.
“There were a lot of things we [the board] were not comfortable with,” Burstyn told me recently, citing complaints from Sidewalk Labs “about how slow and 
bureaucratic we were. We can be, but we believe in good governance. Canadians are regulators, and our governments are very attuned to their responsibility — 
they didn’t realize how American they were in their approach.” The company was told, “You’re just going to have to live with it,” Burstyn said. “Sidewalk never 
fully appreciated that. They were always pushing for more.”
Many critics blamed Waterfront Toronto for a failure to rein in Sidewalk Labs, but Burstyn claims the agency’s intentions were more closely aligned with the 
naysayers than the naysayers realized. “I don’t disagree with anything that Jim Balsillie said. I just don’t like the way he said it,” Burstyn explained. “It 
wasn’t necessary to be insulting to the intelligence or integrity of people who actually do regulate these things.” She discounted theories about the 
government influencing the selection of Sidewalk Labs. “It became seen by some as sinister and prebaked,” she said, “but I don’t think that was actually the 
case.”
Burstyn argues that ultimately, she was fired as a sacrifice in order to move forward with the project. “It was a symbol. They had to do something, so they got 
rid of us. The well had been poisoned.”
“It was a symbol. They had to do something, so they got rid of us. The well had been poisoned”
To anyone paying attention, the writing was on the wall. Anthony Townsend, author of Smart Cities: Big Data, Civic Hackers, and the Quest for a New Utopia, 
worked as a consultant for Sidewalk Labs in 2015 and 2016. He is a proponent of smart cities, but as someone who studies the intersections of technology and 
urban planning, he is keenly aware that the cultures surrounding those professions do not always gel. Townsend told me he eventually walked away when his 
contract expired, in part due to philosophical disagreements with senior leadership. “Their lack of serious thinking about privacy and data governance had been 
a major concern of mine when I was there,” Townsend told me. “I pushed that agenda, but they didn’t see it as a priority.”
Townsend accused Sidewalk Labs of hubris. He said company leadership was largely stocked by people from Michael Bloomberg’s orbit, which created another sort 
of cultural schism. “They had a reputation for being too smart for themselves in New York, so when they got to Toronto, where the culture is much less brash 
and aggressive, they came off as doubly so.” Sidewalk Labs CEO Doctoroff is a “dyed-in-the-wool Wall Street guy,” said Townsend, adding that the company lacked 
a “participatory design approach” for Quayside. “It was a very, very top-down exercise. It’s inevitable today that those kinds of projects get rejected.”
I’d spoken with Doctoroff in December 2018 and asked him about one of the detractors’ top complaints: that Sidewalk Labs had not been transparent about its 
business model. He told me that Balsillie’s rhetoric about commercializing citizens’ data was “ridiculous” and “in bad faith.” While Doctoroff acknowledged 
that Sidewalk Labs hoped to generate revenue from “new technologies” developed in Toronto, he declined to elaborate when I pressed him for details.
The business model, he told me, was to “improve urban life” and to “be a catalyst in the creation of hopefully something extraordinary on the waterfront.” 
Doctoroff grew animated when I pointed out that this sounded more like a marketing pitch than a business model. It seemed reasonable to assume data would play 
a role in the technologies Sidewalk Labs was developing. “That is absolutely false!” he said, raising his voice. “Do not paint us with this brush because of 
our affiliation [with Google].” Sidewalk Labs, he said, “is not first and foremost about making money.”
The Waterfront Toronto board scheduled a final vote on Sidewalk Labs’ revised plan for June this year. But the vote never happened. On a cool spring day in 
early May, Wylie was sitting in her living room when she heard the news: Sidewalk Labs was pulling out. She ran upstairs to her family, shouting, “It’s over! 
It’s over!” she told me recently. “My kids were like, what’s wrong? I was like, no, it’s good!” For more than two and a half years, Wylie had devoted her life 
to the cause. “I was making calls and sending emails right up until this happened,” she said. “It was a major relief. I almost forgot what it felt like to not 
have to worry about it all the time.”
Sidewalk Labs cited the current economic climate as the catalyst for their decision. “I think Covid was the excuse, but their leaving was inevitable,” Burstyn 
told me. “I’m surprised it took them that long.”
Waterfront Toronto has been mum on its next steps for Quayside, but in an email, a spokesman said that “building a next generation community” remains “a key 
deliverable” for the agency. “While our long-term goal remains the same, we will take the time necessary to determine what our next steps will be,” he wrote. 
Before Waterfront Toronto embarks anew to develop “innovative and world-class solutions to urban challenges in a post-pandemic world,” he continued, “we will 
need to evaluate which of our original goals are consistent with these new realities.”
Burstyn was more circumspect in her assessment of Toronto’s smart city future. Post-Covid-19, would a hyperfuturistic development remain a priority? “Forget 
it,” she said. “I think we’re at a point where nobody is going to dream big. We’re going to dream practical.” Affordable housing was a top concern among 
Toronto residents before the pandemic, and in the economic fallout it will only grow as a priority, she said, as an example.
The rise and fall of Quayside coincides with the slow scaling back of other ambitious smart city ventures, such as Masdar City in Abu Dhabi and Songdo near 
Seoul, Townsend said. “All these smart city megaprojects are now fairly conventional real estate projects.” Perhaps the barriers to melding cyberspace with 
physical space are taller than the techno-optimists realized.
Townsend, however, thinks the pandemic will accelerate the transition of internet technology from screens to the real world. Existing trends like telework and 
the shift to e-commerce suddenly seem deeply entrenched — changes in urban infrastructure are inevitable as a result, he said, and that new reality will likely 
be more automated. “We’re fast-forwarding five to 10 years into the digital future,” Townsend said. “So, all the dilemmas that people like Bianca Wylie have 
been raising alarm bells about” — he refers to Wylie as the Jane Jacobs of smart cities — “will become urgent issues that large numbers of people are going to 
be directly affected by. Once the public health situation stabilizes, hopefully we will see more effort put into dealing with all the scary sides of the 
surveillance state that we’re building.”
Perhaps the barriers to melding cyberspace with physical space are taller than the techno-optimists realized
The pandemic has introduced a new suite of data collection concerns — contact tracing apps, temperature scanning as a condition to enter restaurants, biometric 
identity verification at airports. Wylie worries the public is accepting these technologies as emergency measures, and without the realization that once such 
architecture is in place, it may be repurposed down the road for less noble purposes — such as the developing surveillance apparatus in China that critics fear 
spreading into the world’s weakened democracies. Wylie is now a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a think tank founded by 
Balsillie. “Thank god for Bianca Wylie,” Balsillie said the first time I met him, referring to her as “a hero.”
Less than a week after announcing Sidewalk Labs’ withdrawal from Toronto, Doctoroff participated in a webinar organized by the Urban Land Institute in which he 
contemplated the post-Covid-19 future of smart cities. The webinar is not publicly accessible, but according to an Urban Land Institute blog post about it, the 
company plans to apply the research and development that was underway for the Quayside project elsewhere — in places “where they’re committed to a heavy dose 
of innovation,” said Doctoroff, according to the blog post. Following their departure from Toronto, “we’ve been overwhelmed with interest from all over the 
world,” he added. Perhaps the smart city is not dead, but simply in the bardo, on its way to being reborn.
Doctoroff seemed to paint the very picture Wylie fears. According to the blog post, he “believes the crisis ultimately will create an even greater need for 
urban innovation — including the sort of data collection and analysis that had concerned some Toronto residents, which could become important tools for 
controlling the spread of future disease outbreaks akin to COVID-19.” The pandemic, then, could be a Trojan horse for data-gathering projects far beyond 
Sidewalk Lab’s wildest dreams for Quayside. Doctoroff likened it to New Yorkers who “adjusted to a network of surveillance cameras installed in lower Manhattan 
after the September 11 attacks.”
The public has grown far more sophisticated in its understanding of surveillance issues since then, however, and far more skeptical of the benevolent 
intentions of Silicon Valley. And with the defeat of Quayside, the activists, academics, and business elite that comprise the tech reform movement, if one 
could call it that, have a playbook for future battles.
Everything will change in six days, when George Floyd stops breathing under the knee of a white police officer. But for now, it is May 19, an ordinary day 
during a global pandemic, and Brianna Blackmon is just waking up in her bedroom in Columbia, South Carolina, where she lives with her boyfriend and their 
blue-nose pit bull, DJ.
Blackmon showers, carefully applies powder-blue eyeshadow in the bathroom mirror, and marbles her lips with a muted sparkle gloss. The shirt she picks out is a 
simple crop top, on which the phrase “More Self-Love” is printed. Blackmon is a 23-year-old musician who performs under the name BJ From the Burbs. After she 
finishes her morning routine, she walks into her home office to record a new freestyle. The space doubles as a makeshift studio, and today's session will be 
extra special. Once there, comfortably situated on the couch, Blackmon opens the TikTok app on her phone and taps Record.
The night before, Blackmon got word about Blackout Day, a demonstration of solidarity among Black users on TikTok who claim the platform is unfairly censoring 
them. To show unity, all creators were asked to switch their avatars to an image of a Black Power fist. She wants this freestyle to be her contribution. By the 
sixth take, Blackmon lands on a version she's happy with and uploads it to her 176,000 followers. Over a slow-building trap beat, she rides the bubbling 
momentum. “Black creators on this app have had enough,” she raps. “So we switched our pictures, put our fists up just to say what's up.” Before long, the 
53-second freestyle is doing numbers, making rounds on other users' personal feeds—the algorithmically driven For You pages. The praise floods in.
“Go awf,” comments @vixxienewell.
“YESS!!!” says @taylorcassidyj, one of the app's more visible Black creators.
“I have chills mama,” says @seiricean.
Adds @d_damodel: “Ayeeee ok ”
Blackmon uploads three more videos throughout the day. In one, she urges followers to donate “to the collection plate in my bio” (aka her CashApp). None of 
them performs quite as well as the initial freestyle, but she's satisfied and considers the day a win.
When Blackmon opens TikTok again the following morning—“to check my views,” she says—she realizes something has gone wrong. Her freestyle post is still there, 
but it's now silent. The audio has been completely removed. In her three months on the app, it's a first. “You know how you get an instinct where you're like, 
‘That's not right’?” Blackmon tells me in June, when we talk by phone. “That one did not sit well with my spirit.”
TikTok often mutes posts for violating its community guidelines, but Blackmon isn't told which guideline she violated. As is typical in these cases, she's 
given no explanation or notice of any kind. She reflects back on the video—no cursing, no hate speech, nothing too controversial. When she looks for a way to 
appeal the decision, she can't find one. She's left only with a suspicion, a taste of something bitter. “It's not just me,” Blackmon says. “They are picking on 
certain types of creators.”
The following day, sans makeup, Blackmon uploads another video, done in one off-the-cuff take. “Isn't this funny—TikTok doesn't silence Black creators?” she 
says in a mocking tone. “Then why did they take my sound down from my video, from my pro-Black rap that went viral yesterday? I wonder.” It was almost too 
absurd. Blackmon made a video protesting censorship—and was censored. Is this what it meant to be Black and unapologetic on TikTok?
TikTok has an irresistible draw. In my casual use, I often find myself spellbound by its gonzo humor and mini-blockbusters, full of conceptual daring. The 
app's directive, it seems, is to optimize happiness. But something lurks beneath the gloss. As TikTok has grown to more than 800 million users, it has begun to 
mirror the larger world: the quirks, passions, and prejudices of the people who have started to populate and influence the form. I'd heard stories like 
Blackmon's, bits and pieces of discouragement and grievance, but I wanted to understand it fully. So I started reaching out to TikTokers in all parts of the 
country, some veterans of the app, others new to it, to learn about their experiences, to see what was going on.
Over a period of two months, I heard from 29 Black creators who shared stories about muted posts, in-app harassment, and incidents of racism. They said the 
problems on the app are deeper and more widespread than simple isolated incidents. “Ever since I joined I've felt like the app is against me,” one told me. 
Another added, “It's disgusting how much they have allowed to go unchecked.” Together, their experiences belie the perception of TikTok as an app of joy and 
creativity, revealing instead a place tangled up in an ancient pain—a site of blurred visions and youthful ignorances, where flattery quickly turns into 
mockery, mockery into theft, and theft into something altogether more disturbing.
BEFORE SHE MADE it big on TikTok, Blackmon had built modest followings on other platforms. On YouTube, she posted videos about her life in a series she called 
STORYTIME. She talked about getting married at 19 (she's since divorced) and the time she tried (and failed, hilariously) to work as a stripper. Building an 
audience on Instagram proved harder. “You have to be on vacation,” Blackmon says, “or doing something extravagant,” which she wasn't. She didn't feel as if she 
could be herself.
Another app Blackmon checked out, but only as a spectator, was Vine. Launched in 2013, Vine was TikTok before TikTok. With a remarkably simple premise—upload 
six-second videos that would loop infinitely—Vine appealed to a dopamine-crazed culture that desired virality in short, repetitive bursts.
But the real allure of the app could be traced, in large part, to the ingenuity of the Black creators who made much of its most irresistible content. Bought by 
Twitter in 2012, Vine became the dominant engine of Black culture on the internet from around 2014 to 2016. It rivaled Twitter in its capacity to incubate 
trends, hyping Southern dance crazes such as the Nae Nae and career-boosting comedians like King Bach. “I was there for the short comedy,” Blackmon says. 
Arguably Vine's biggest impact was how it mainstreamed Black slang. In one of the most recognized Vines during that period, 16-year-old Kayla Newman—best known 
by her alias, Peaches Monroee—delights in her own fabulousness. “On fleek” was born, and The Culture adjusted accordingly.
The app eventually went bust. Its success led competitors, like Instagram, to create their own video features. And unlike YouTube, Vine never figured out a way 
to share revenue with users; a deal to pay top creators to produce content fell through in 2015. Big names departed the platform, and revenues dwindled. In 
2017, Twitter shut down Vine, and it was mourned largely by millennials and Gen Zers who'd made a home on the platform.
Around that time, ByteDance, a Beijing-based tech company at the forefront of Chinese social media, was launching an app called Douyin. In the early days, it 
was used to create homemade music videos, but users quickly turned it into a marketplace for all sorts of short-form content. By 2018, ByteDance had released 
the app outside China, acquired the lip-sync app Musical.ly, and renamed the international version TikTok. Vine supercharged—videos were now capped at 15 
seconds, and later 60—TikTok also offered a suite of editing tools, from filters to green-screen special effects, that gave creators near-limitless 
possibilities.
In the beginning, TikTok's embrace of wackiness and absence of anything even marginally serious was its prime attraction, and its most marketable one. Twitter 
was preoccupied with millennial bickering; the election of Donald Trump turned Facebook into a political echo chamber; Instagram felt plastic; gamers ran 
Twitch. On TikTok, kids just wanted to have fun. It was a place for dance challenges and wellness how-tos, movie reviews and the kind of existence-pondering 
comedy sketches BoJack Horseman might post were he on the app (or real). The platform elevated creativity and experimentation above all else; its algorithm, as 
Blackmon puts it, is generous. Though personalized based on user activity, For You feeds retain a light randomness—according to TikTok, the algorithm tries to 
avoid duplicating content or privileging accounts with large followings. As Blackmon says, “it's one of the only places where you can have no following, no 
content, and you post one thing and it gets a million views in a day.”
Blackmon signed up for TikTok in February, about a month before the Covid-19 stay-at-home orders started coming down. Like a diary, many of her early videos 
chronicle daily mundanities—cooking a buffalo chicken wrap, talking about natural hair, declaring a newfound love for iced coffee. “I don't know what Caucasian 
woman got into me, but iced coffee—bitch!” Blackmon says, raising the glass into the video frame. “Well call me Karen, OK,” she jokes, invoking the meme for 
privileged white womanhood. With more than half a million views, it was her first viral hit; she'd been on the app less than a month. A week later, she struck 
gold again. A video of Blackmon dancing with a stranger in the restroom mirror at a club racked up 615,000 views.
TikTok, it turned out, was reminiscent of Vine in more ways than one. The common denominator of many of its viral moments is an unspoken partiality to Black 
cultural expression. It works like an accelerant. Chart-topping rap songs, from the likes of Drake and K Camp and Megan Thee Stallion, provide the soundtrack 
to weekly dance challenges. Lil Nas X is the app's first breakout artist, and its most recognized pedagogue around self-improvement, Tabitha Brown, is a Black 
mother and vegan from North Carolina. When, at the end of 2019, a random voicemail of a Black woman colorfully referring to her coworker Rachel as a “big, fat, 
white, nasty-smelling, fat bitch” began to circulate, the woman's hostility and perceived sassiness became a costume for everyone to put on and make their own. 
The collective fascination again proved the point. As Blackmon puts it, “Be clear: Without Black culture, TikTok wouldn't even be a thing.”
Other creators, the majority of them white, have figured that out, too. In fact, they've come to learn that the quickest route to success on TikTok is right 
through the bountiful fields of Black expression.
IN A VIDEO uploaded to TikTok last December, a white teen saunters through an airport terminal, roller suitcase in hand. As he passes the check-in counter for 
Spirit—the notoriously awful low-cost airline—a look of mild irritation crosses his face. He glances left, then right. “Whew chile, the ghetto,” he says, 
elongating the o in ghetto. Only it's not the young man's voice we hear. It's that of reality diva NeNe Leakes, whose audio was pulled, edited, and 
resynchronized for the eight-second clip.
Chris Guarino, the guy with the suitcase, is an 18-year-old college student in South Florida. He joined TikTok “as a joke,” according to his bio, and his posts 
are generally preoccupied with goofball antics. Typical fare: In a video from last year, he mocks his dog Coco for having a “little potato booty.” On a good 
day, Guarino is lucky to get 1,000 eyes on a post. That is, until December, when he uploaded the Spirit airline parody. It became his biggest hit, exceeding 
half a million views.
Videos like Guarino's are among a disturbing and ongoing form of content production that suggests a twisted love of Black culture through caricature. It's been 
called digital blackface, and Blackmon started seeing examples of it almost immediately after she joined TikTok, mostly being posted by young white women and 
white gay men. “I have never seen so many teenagers who are this race-obsessed,” she says. “My Blackness is not a show, it's not something you just turn on.” 
Another user, 19-year-old Mia Brier, calls it “low-key racism”—you might have to sit with it for a moment before the extent of the ugliness becomes clear. 
(Guarino did not respond to messages seeking comment and before press time deleted his TikTok account.)
Minstrelsy thrives on TikTok, but the phenomenon goes back a long way. The earliest American iterations emerged in the 1840s as a form of entertainment and 
endured for more than a century. White people would darken their skin with burnt cork, greasepaint, or shoe polish and perform in variety shows. The musical 
acts, comedy sketches, and dances relied on stock characters, like Sambo and Zip Coon, to parade Blackness as laughably uneducated or as a target of 
humiliation. By the 1950s, the shows fell out of favor, but as Lauren Michele Jackson, the academic and author of White Negroes, put it, “the tenets of 
minstrel performance remain alive today in television, movies, music, and, in its most advanced iteration, on the internet.”
“My Blackness is not a show.”

The very tools that have made TikTok into one of the most efficient, visible cultural products of the era—easy to use, hypercustomizable—make instances of 
digital blackface uniquely personal. Unlike Facebook and Twitter, where instances of digital blackface are either text-based (abusing Black vernacular) or 
image-based (trotting out memes or GIFs of Black celebrities), TikTok is a video-first platform, and on it, creators embody Blackness with an auteur-driven 
virtuosity—taking on Black rhythms, gestures, affect, slang. The most effective videos come down to one factor: how well a creator grabs hold of our attention. 
That is to say, how deftly they make what we watch theirs. Blackness is a proven attention getter. Its adoption is racism, custom-fit.
One highly visible avatar of the trend is the Hot Cheeto Girl, a meme that plays on the image of a loud and defiant low-income youth. The hashtag has over 160 
million views and is one of the app's more slippery instances of cultural distortion. For Whitney Roberts, a 35-year-old writer and podcast host in Philly, 
trends like the Hot Cheeto Girl have a troubling history that exemplify just one way already marginalized people are subtly debased on the app. “There were 
little white girls slicking their edges and drawing their eyebrows all weird,” Roberts says. “They would wrap tape around their fingers to be their fake nails. 
They'd put hoops on. When you call them out, it's, ‘Anyone of any race can be a Hot Cheeto Girl.’ No sweetheart, we know what you're doing. We know that the 
Hot Cheeto Girl is just a derivative of the ghetto girl, the hood rat, the Shanaynay that people used to call Black and Latinx women.” (TikTok has said it does 
not allow blackface, but how broadly it interprets blackface is an open question. Impersonations for the purposes of “parody” or “commentary” are permitted.)
The TikTok challenge is another fraught avenue for remixing racial stereotypes. Even if you follow TikTok only from a distance, you've likely heard about 
challenges. Usually started by a creator or influencer, a challenge spans all sorts of silliness. They include things like seeing which creator can best 
choreograph a dance (#Renegade) and who can swap clothes with their partner in the funniest way (#FlipTheSwitch). They spread from the original post outward, 
each creator attempting to put their own spin on it. The result has engendered a lively, sometimes strange culture of competition within the TikTok community.
Sometime on April 14, Carter Ricket uploaded the first iteration of what would become known as the #HowsMyForm challenge. In the opening frame, 17-year-old 
Ricket sets the bait with a raunchy caption: “Best S3X positions for guys with 9–12-inchers.” The challenge is meant to capitalize on a racial stereotype, 
which is soon made explicit. As rapper 645AR's song “Yoga” plays in the background, a new caption appears, insisting: “Ok, now that all the black guys are here 
can you help me with my waves!” The video garnered over 423,000 views and birthed one monstrous iteration after the next.
Almost every #HowsMyForm video played on degrading stereotypes of some kind—Middle Eastern people as terrorists, Mexicans as border-hopping illegal immigrants, 
poor white people as inbred hicks—and the majority of these videos use a three-act structure. The opening frame begins with a creator staring or lip-syncing 
into the camera as a “how to” statement pops on-screen (such as: “How to make the best fried chicken”); the next frame is followed by a greeting (such as: “Now 
that all the black people are here”); the stunt culminates in the third frame and typically ends on the very question—How's my form?—from which the challenge 
draws its name. Some of the most insidious satirize slavery. When viewers reach the final seconds of TikToker @Kalebcram's video, he freezes in place, bending 
forward as he pretends to pick cotton. “Hows my form,” the caption reads.
TikTok offers creators countless ways to customize their actions for the amusement and delight of scrollers. @Kalebcram chose to adorn his bent-over posture 
with a Photoshopped cotton plant and a meme of Martin Luther King Jr., just in case you didn't get the joke.
RACIAL MOCKERY IS not, I have to assume, the sole aim of these posts. What non-Black creators ultimately desire is what most TikTok creators desire—virality, clout, followers. To be seen and memed. One white TikToker I spoke with, Morgan Eckroth, a 21-year-old barista in Corvallis, Oregon, fears that many of her fellow creators don't understand the larger consequences of what they're doing. “Virality often occurs through shocking behavior,” says Eckroth, whose fame is mostly rooted in videos about making coffee in a small town. “Whether it's acting provocatively, bullying, or using racial slurs and stereotypes, a lot of users see that their questionable behavior gets a reaction, and that just encourages them.”
“You don’t need to get all worked up over this.” “You’re too angry for me to understand the point you’re making.” “Calm down.”
These phrases are all examples of tone policing, or responding to the presentation of an argument rather than the content of the argument itself. At its best, 
tone policing is an irritating behavior pattern that blocks meaningful conversation. But at its worst, tone policing is an insidious and sometimes 
hard-to-grasp method of reinforcing elitism and structural racism.
Tone policing is as rampant online as it is in person. As workplaces, schools, friends, and family groups continue to responsibly social distance, we’re 
spending more and more time communicating virtually. In these online arenas, tone policing can create space for pile-on responses, derailing a discussion when 
someone from the privileged side of the conversation focuses on the presentation of an argument rather than its content and all the following responses “pile 
on” to this language critique. …
orthwest of beijing’s Forbidden City, outside the Third Ring Road, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has spent seven decades building a campus of national 
laboratories. Near its center is the Institute of Automation, a sleek silvery-blue building surrounded by camera-studded poles. The institute is a basic 
research facility. Its computer scientists inquire into artificial intelligence’s fundamental mysteries. Their more practical innovations—iris recognition, 
cloud-based speech synthesis—are spun off to Chinese tech giants, AI start-ups, and, in some cases, the People’s Liberation Army.
